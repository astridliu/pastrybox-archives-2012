At the beginning of, and indeed well into the 19th century, only a small percentage of even people in the
then-developed world were in any modern sense literate.

And yet, the percentage of people in Western Europe and North America at that time who could read and write
probably exceeds the percentage in those places now who can program in any non-trivial sense.

The rise of literacy in the 19th Century was largely a side effect of the need for clerical skills in a
rapidly industrialising world, but gave rise to the modern world of medicine, science, and literature as a
critical mass of the population gained the capacity to improve themselves.

I believe, and hope the next great wave of literacy, with a similarly unpredictable but extraordinary impact
on civilisation for the better, will be programmatic literacy, the near ubiquitous ability to program
computers.

This doesnâ€™t mean everyone in the world using JavaScript. In fact, part of the challenge is for us to
find ways to lower the barriers to programming that tend to hold people back from something which humans are
actually typically quite good at.

The web is an enormous step toward this possibility, but not until we start seeing these core skills in
primary schools, taught alongside reading, writing, and mathematics, will we start seeing what sort of
revolution an explosion of programming literacy might bring.
