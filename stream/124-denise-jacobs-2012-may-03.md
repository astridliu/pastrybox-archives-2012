I had a fairly recent DM conversation with Nishant Kothary ([@rainypixels](https://twitter.com/rainypixels))
about our love-hate relationship with Twitter (you can read his thoughts in detail
[here](http://visitmix.com/opinions/Dear-Twitter) and
[here](http://rainypixels.com/writings/journal/life-after-twitter/)). For me, not only can Twitter be
addictive, it is more often than not the promulgator of a down-spiral of self-flagellation based on
comparing myself with the perceived achievements of others. 

My anecdote to this pernicious virus? Boundaries. Rules. The first is a physical practice: to maintain my
equilibrium, I only read @mentions and DMs. The second is a mental practice: be self-referential. There is a
saying that you can’t judge a person’s outsides to your own insides. So, instead of beating myself up over
what I have not done yet, I make a concentrated effort to look back and give myself props for the things that
I *have* done and the progress that I have made in my life and career. If your [inner
critic](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/banishing-your-inner-critic/) is working overtime (I’m
working on firing mine), then focusing on your own process and how you feel about it usually helps.
