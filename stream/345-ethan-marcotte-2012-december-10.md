I keep talking about making it easier to do certain things I used to *love* making time for. Writing, reading,
designing—whatever. I’ve gotten very good at identifying a problem—it’s far too difficult to write
blog entries on my phone! I don’t have enough free time to read! I’m hurting for decent ideas!—and
focusing on solving it before I can, well, do the thing I’ve been missing. So I’ll schedule time to
convert my blog to some more phone-friendly platform, or plan for the books I’ll read once my projects wrap
up, or scribble down ideas for sites, for projects I’ll work on in the future.

The real problem is, of course, me. There is, as they say, no time like the present; maybe it’s worth
remembering that, and starting to do the things I love in the moment. I miss them.
