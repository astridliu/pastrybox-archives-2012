Last week [Keir](http://keirwhitaker.com/) and I spoke at [HD Live](http://2012.hd-live.co.uk/) in Hull,
England. After the event, the film crew asked us, ‘what do you hope the audience takes away from your
talk?’ We’d spoken about the logistics of turning a side project into a legitimate business — a subject
very close to my heart — and I replied by saying that I hoped at least one person in the theatre felt
motivated enough to go out and try it; to take an idea that they’d previously thought of as a pipe dream and
make moves to give it more prominence in their lives — to do more of it, to have more fun, and to make money
from doing it.

We all have ideas. Many of us — in our industry, at least — have side projects. But so few of us actually
take those ideas beyond the conceptual realm and try them out in the real world. Perhaps it’s a fear of
failure or a lack of security, but I truly believe that the risks are far smaller than commonly perceived.
It’s not all-or-nothing. You can build up your side projects slowly, you can approach the right people for a
bit of financial backing, and selling products — rather than building countless revenue-less start-ups —
is one of the oldest, most successful — *still* successful! — tricks in the book.

I hope that one person reading this decides to take the same plunge.
