       <p>For the last several decades, we&#8217;ve created varieties of the same CRUD tool. Whether it&#8217;s writing a Word doc, posting to Facebook, or checking in with FourSquare, these are all tools for Creating (and Reading, Updating, Deleting) information. Add to this all the ways to passively collect data—your mobile phone alone collects more than 700 points of data per day—and we&#8217;ve got a curious situation: Too much information and no good way to make sense of it all. We need new tools for understanding this information. Tools that let us explore, evaluate, and synthesize information. Tools that support cognitively complex activities. </p><p>When people ask me about &#8220;what&#8217;s next in design?&#8221; I think about this problem of too much information. New planets are discovered nearly every week, it seems, while back on Earth companies are scratching their heads trying to figure out what to do with all their customer data. We have scientists looking for patterns in strands of DNA. From cinematography to medicine, we&#8217;re getting sharper details—what used to be a few x-rays on a lightbox is now a terrabyte of data mapping your entire body. Add to this the growing number of people monitoring their own health patterns, social interactions, and all sort of minutia, and we&#8217;ve got some thrilling challenges waiting for us! How are we going to help turn information into understanding?</p><p>I favor visualizations as a way to make sense of it all, if only for the reason that our sense of vision is the most highly evolved sensory organ, capable of picking out minute differences in detail. Much has been written about the power images and pictures to aid in understanding. But there&#8217;s more to come than infographics and data visualizations displayed on a screen. Consider how coupled interaction is with thinking. We don&#8217;t necessarily think and then do. We also think through doing. When you hold a chess piece in mid-air, considering possible moves, the board has become part of your thinking space. You are using the chess board to extend beyond the limitations of your short-term, working memory. In this way, the environment outside of our bodies helps us to think and understand. Karl Fast says it best: &#8220;the problem space is now partly in the head and partly in the world, with interaction linking and blending these two spaces together.&#8221; By interacting with this external representation we have the potential to learn more deeply and to see more options, as with the chess player evaluating possible outcomes. This is partly why I favor interactive visualization. But what happens when interactions involve far more than a simple mouse click or tap of the finger? What happens when communication, movement, motion, position and other forms of interaction become part of the designers toolbox? That, for me, is a thrilling future. New forms of interaction helping us make sense of the world around us… CRUD tools, and to be fair, tools for sorting, filtering and searching content, are going to seem crude when compared to whatever comes next! </p>
