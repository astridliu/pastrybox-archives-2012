After the launch of [www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk/), the coverage we were most excited about was that in
the printed press, particularly those found in glossy design magazines. This is not to say that we
didn’t have any other kind of press online, just that this was a particular type that seemed to garner
the most respect, despite our remit being “digital by default”.

Be it an article in a magazine or a complete, published, book, many of us are still swayed to believe that the
printed medium is somehow better, more tangible and respectable.  That an author has more of
value to say if it’s printed on paper rather than accessible purely digitally. Why is this?  Is it
not part of our remit as digital citizens to encourage less wasteful and informationally accurate
consumerism?

Printing digitally comes with so many benefits: you can update information with corrections, annotations,
further information.  Digital can be interactive, more easily shared and produced in a wider number of
languages more easily. It can take unusual forms, and it can be more accessible. Yet still, many of us are
excited or prefer a physical book, fixed in time and would consider the printed version superior.

Is it the additional effort associated with physical print that gives it its significance?  Something
that cost more money to produce, could last longer, can be touched and shared, and is not necessarily
“of web”. How or will we recreate these properties of value in digital medium, or will the special
place that paper holds for many of us eventually disappear naturally?
