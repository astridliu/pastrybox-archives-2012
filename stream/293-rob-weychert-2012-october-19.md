There is a popular myth in geek circles which claims that the QWERTY layout standard for Latin keyboards was
actually designed to slow down typing, since early typewriters were prone to jam. While this is a
misunderstanding (jams were caused by the mechanical proximity of common letter pairs, not the speed of
typing), it has occasionally made me wonder: could technological shortcomings that ostensibly get in the way
of the user experience actually, ultimately, be good for the user?

Over the years, I’ve used several different content management systems for sites I designed for clients or
for myself. But lately, I don’t seem to have the curiosity or patience to learn new CMSs or even to
integrate my designs with ones I’ve used in the past. So when I was redesigning [my personal
site](http://robweychert.com/) last year in the hopes of getting back to writing regularly, I decided I would
launch without a CMS and make updates to the site the old-fashioned way by hand-editing text files. For me,
the long-term inconvenience of this relatively archaic method was preferable to the short-term inconvenience
of dealing with CMS integration.

As a result, when I post a new piece of writing on the site, I usually need to update about five to seven text
files with varying degrees of hassle and redundancy. This probably sounds like a nightmare to anyone who has
ever had to manage a web site in any capacity; this kind of inefficiency is antithetical to the goals of
modern computing. But the year I’ve spent publishing with this system has been my most prolific one yet,
even more than those halcyon days when the site was running on a robust CMS and the blogging zeitgeist was in
full force.

There are two specific, external factors that have had a substantial impact on my site’s recent
fecundity:

 *  __The Pastry Box Project__, a blog that collects the wisdom of thirty-one influential web professionals,
which asks that I submit something once a month, and which you’re visiting right now.

 *  __[Letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com/)__, a social site for film buffs whose thoughtful design has
encouraged me to write frequent short-form film reviews.

In the last year, 83% of the posts (and 73% of the word count) on my site were republished content I created
for The Pastry Box Project, Letterboxd, and a few other external sites, so I clearly have publishing systems
other than my own to thank for the lion’s share of the writing I’ve done. Still, I’ve grown to enjoy
using my site’s laborious non-CMS, and I think it’s encouraged my writing in its own way.

For one thing, there’s a hand-crafted element to working in static text files that’s very satisfying.
Marking up the semantics of my writing in its native HTML environment feels like a more personal endeavor than
typing into a WYSIWYG interface meant to shield me from the complexity hiding beneath it. For another thing,
the sizable inconvenience of editing several files for every site update makes each post feel more
consequential, which has paradoxically made my approach to writing both more and less precious: I take extra
time to make sure everything is just right before publishing and I rarely get bogged down in minutia-driven
revisions after. So once something is done, it’s done, and I can move on to the next thing.

Creating a system that increases the work necessary to complete a task is understandably rare. But in this
case, I’ve found the extra work to be more rewarding than the sensibly efficient alternative. Whether or not
my non-CMS is comparable to the differences between manual and automatic transmissions or artisanal and
manufactured products, there can be benefits to adding complexity to our relationships with the things we
create and consume. So I’ll be on the lookout for other areas where inefficiency is my friend.
