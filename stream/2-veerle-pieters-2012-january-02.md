Considering my heavy workload, and the fact that things are always so busy, someone was asking me how I manage
to stay creative at all times, and how I always find the motivation to design as best I can. I thought about
it for a bit. Time is a factor that plays a major role in the creative process. To be able to stay at your
best creativity-wise, you sometimes need extra time. As a creator, you can always create 'something' in a
short period of time, but you won't be able to give it your best if that period is really short. Give yourself
extra time and you will create something way better. Sometimes it's good to let a project rest and look back.
Sometimes you have a creativity block and you really need a break. I think it's important with every project
to make sure you have enough time; that little extra can make the difference. This movie shows exactly what I
