       <p>These are exciting times at the moment as far as developing for the web goes, but do you get the feeling that sometimes things move at too fast a pace to catch up and you are getting left behind? I certainly do.</p><p>There’s a lot to keep an eye on with CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, media queries and mobile devices all surging forward almost every day. It’s easy to take your eye off the ball and lose sight of what’s going on in the world of web design. I often get buried in a project and the next time I look up something else new has come along. We can’t all be experts in every discipline but we do need to keep track of what’s going on and then reflect best practices in our coding/design. There’s no point in trying to learn or remember everything but you should at least know where to look. As Einstein was reported to have said “I never remember anything that I can easily look up” — or words to that effect.</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago that properties like border-radius were seldom used but now most everyone uses them and even clients aren’t worried that older browsers such as IE8 get square corners. It seems that even some clients can be educated. Who would have thought?</p><p>So don’t be frightened of change.</p><p>It’s a fact of life that things change, so don’t forget to look up from time to time and keep abreast of what else is going on around you and how you could improve what you are doing. It’ll soon be time for a new year’s resolution so why not set aside some time each week to brush up on your skills, maybe learn some new CSS3 properties, experiment with a few new features, or just see what’s hot and what’s not. Just stay informed — it’ll pay dividends in the end I’m sure.</p>
