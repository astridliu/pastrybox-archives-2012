I’ve recently finished my chapter for the upcoming Smashing Book #3 (and #3 1/3). For me, writing sometimes
(still!) is a very daunting process: my tendency is to believe that I have to produce everything on my own –
that I have to formulate and articulate brilliant ideas whilst tapping away on a computer, isolated in my
house with no more than my cats as outlets for conversation. 

During this process, however, I’ve confirmed what I have been preaching in recent presentations: that
collaboration makes the brain blossom. The comfort of knowing that I’m not producing something alone –
that many people are involved and invested in making what we are creating collectively the best possible –
gives me the space to be less critical of myself. I then feel that I have the space to explore to make
mistakes and discoveries, and reach epiphanies of insight along the way.

I’m definitely fan and am ready for even more collaboration.
