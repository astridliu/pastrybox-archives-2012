       <p>For this pastry box, I'm just going to ask some questions. Places where my head is at.</p><ul><li>Do you have a work ethic? </li><li>Do you tell your clients how long something will take? </li><li>If you're running late on that, do you let them know ahead of time? </li><li>Are you willing to bust your ass to get something done when you said it would be done?</li><li>Do you expect your client to be the project manager or will you lead it?</li><li>Can you explain what you've designed or do you expect the client to blindly trust you?</li><li>Do you command enough authority in a project to help keep it on track when a client tries to become the designer?</li><li>Are you willing to comp a client when the time it took to complete a project was grossly under your estimate?</li><li>Are you opinionated about how business should be run? Have you thought about it at all?</li><li>Do you call your clients often, or do you always wait to have them call you?</li><li>Does your client know what's coming next in the project, or are they always a little bewildered by the process? Have you asked them?</li><li>If you asked all your former clients to be honest about your performance as a business, not just as a designer, would you be confident or nervous about their response?</li></ul><p>Stuff you should be considering. Our industry will never have the authority we need in the coming era if we remain weak in these areas. Press on!</p>
