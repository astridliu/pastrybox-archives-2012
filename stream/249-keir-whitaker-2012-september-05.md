The videos from the recent [WordCamp San Francisco](http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org/) are now available over at
[WordPress TV](http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-san-francisco-2012/). All talks were 15 minutes long which
makes them very accessible. Of particular interest to me was Chris Coyier’s session “10 Things to
make your site faster”. If you deal with WordPress as part of your work it’s well worth 15 minutes
of your time. As a bonus you’ll also learn how to blow up you Apache server!
