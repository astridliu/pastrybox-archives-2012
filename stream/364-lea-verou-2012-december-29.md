My last Pastry Box thought is due to be published on December 29th. It’s already the 28th and I’m way past
my deadline. I’m sitting in a hospital room, next to my mother who was admitted ten days ago. Even before
that, my life had already taken a pretty tumultuous turn and started to resemble a fully-fledged soap opera.
It had everything a good TV series does: Drama, disappointment, plot twists, even villains. With all the
craziness that’s been going on, don’t expect this to be another tech-related post. Instead, I decided to
write a coping mechanism that helped me get over many disappointments over the years: forgiveness. It even
fits with the theme of these days.

It all started a little over 20 years ago. My mother had a very old unabridged edition of Victor Hugo’s
“Les Misérables”, which she read to me every night as I was growing up. She had inherited it from her own
mother who also read it at her bedside when she was little. Eventually I grew more confident of my own reading
skills and finished it by myself. That novel is how I learned my very first lessons on morals, justice and
love. I’ve read many other books since then, but that one always holds a very special place in my heart, as
it practically shaped my character.

It taught me to strive to see the good in others, even when they are doing everything in their power to hide
it. Our mistrust is our armor and we’re terrified that giving it up will lead to more pain and
disappointment. However, I’ve found that expecting good often brings out the best in others too. People are
rarely evil, most are just weak, misguided or both. 

It taught me to do my best to understand before I judge, because no matter how reprehensible someone’s
actions look, we’re usually not as far from doing the same as we think.

Most importantly, it taught me to opt for forgiveness over vengeance, because responding to wrongdoings with
kindness can change people. Love and compassion are infectious, whereas revenge will only make everyone
poorer. After all, when you understand someone’s motivations and weaknesses, it becomes impossible to hold a
grudge.

Contrary to popular belief, forgiveness is not primarily altruistic, which is why I called it a coping
mechanism. Resentment builds up inside you and makes you bitter. Instead, holding no grudges leads to peace of
mind, a prerequisite of happiness. Being able to forgive and move on does way more good to yourself than to
anyone else.

Forgiveness and self-preservation aren’t mutually exclusive. It would certainly be masochistic to have
people around you that constantly disappoint and hurt you, wouldn’t it? Forgiving doesn’t mean you have to
be a martyr and allow toxic people to continue poisoning your life. You can both forgive someone and distance
yourself from them.

Naïve as it may sound, this way of thinking has always helped me get over disappointments more quickly and
prevented many more. Let this new year bring more happiness and less resentment. You won’t regret it.
