Of all the things I’ve learned this year—and believe me, there’ve been a lot—I realize what an asset
it was to have a wide array of mobile devices nearby as I worked, especially for a large-scale responsive
site. As we design further and further beyond the desktop, device access is going to become a real challenge
for our industry to overcome. Nothing shapes your design decisions like holding a device in your hand, and
interacting with it just as your users might.
