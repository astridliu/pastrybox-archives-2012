In an industry like this, it’s often difficult not to get bogged down by our tools. It’s easy to
forget how we started out — viewing the source of web pages and stringing bits of knowledge together to
create something sub-par, before scratching our heads and posting on forums for help. It’s the way we
all start. But somewhere along the way, we develop a dependence on certain tools.

As someone who moves around a lot, I can’t guarantee that the computer I’ll end up on has the
tools I need. I’ve adopted my workflow time and time again to better fit this circumstance, but one
thing has remained the same — always carrying a pen and paper with me. Those are the primary tools. With
them you can design an entire website or write the pseudo code for an entire application. And it requires no
preprocessors, no software updates, and no Internet connectivity.
