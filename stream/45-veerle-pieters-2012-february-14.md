As a busy graphic designer spending so much time on projects for clients, I find it very helpful to do some
creative work that has nothing to do with work, especially when you are working on a big project that takes
months, and where you have to stay focused on the same design for such a long time.

I think it's important to keep your creativity at its best. That's why I try to spend every day 10 to 15
minutes creating something that isn't work related. It could be a drawing in one of my sketchbooks, or just
some doodling, or it could be something done in Illustrator. I prefer going the analogue way as I already
spend so much time in front of my computer. So it's usually pencil and paper, watercolor, or even scissors and
glue to create a fun collage. My creative mind follows another path during those few minutes, and doing so has
a revigorating, stimulating effect on me.
