    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>I grew up in the middle of the UK in the 70s and 80s reading authors like Tolkien, Asimov, and Dumas. Dumas&#8217;s adventure via adversity stories were a band-aid for the almost-daily racial slights of school life at the time. Asimov&#8217;s grandeur distracted me from feeling dislocated at the irrelevant fact of me being mixed race. Tolkien&#8217;s nobility sustained me as I helped my Mum run a one-parent family.</p><p>When I was the age my eldest son is now, my father would cane me for staying up late reading after bedtime. Granted, I pretty much ignored his more polite requests, and used to hide under the covers with a torch, trying to listen out for the creak of his step on the stairs. It was impossible to simultaneously be immersed in the world on the page, and have the sensory keenness of a sentry in an observation post. My Dad always managed to catch me. I would grin in embarrassment, and almost admiration at his silent skill. Later, I would tightly coil up inside with trepidation when I was caught. A caning was my father&#8217;s perverse expression of love, demonstrated by his determination that I should get some sleep so I could concentrate in school. I needed to concentrate because I needed to do well in school. I needed to do well in school to have a good life. Education lead to wealth, and that would insulate me from suffering. At least, so he believed. Books were just too good to resist, though. I was addicted. I took the canings yet still read. My father left soon after. Books became an escape as well as an addiction.</p><p>When I got older I discovered authors like <a href="http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>. His optimism for the near future was overwhelming. Visions like <a href="http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/w/index.php5?title=Pacific_Edge">Pacific Edge</a> may be utopic, but they are seductive and emblematic. I wanted to live in a world like that of <a href="http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/w/index.php5?title=Blue_Mars">Blue Mars</a>. I read <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a> and marvelled at the erudition of <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/crypt/">Cryptonomicon</a>, and the raw power of <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/snowcrash/">Snow Crash</a>. I wanted to know the things he and his characters knew.</p><p>I started to realise that I was an optimist, too. I had to be, because my disquiet at the world around me gave me scant choice. I had to believe in our innate humanity and potential for empathy, compassion, and goodness. I started to believe that if you remove the suffering and stress from people&#8217;s lives, the vast majority of people would do right by their fellow humans. I believed in Kim Stanley Robinsonâ€™s vision for a future where a revolution by law and evolution in technology would remove suffering. I believed that characters like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Condensed_narrative">Hiro Protagonist</a>, even if they were outside conventional power structures, could help bring that about. I think I know and work with some of his real-world avatars today.</p><p>The faith and optimism of my core beliefs are one of the reasons why I do what I do. I never did stop reading. I left university early, and didn&#8217;t stop reading. I wandered around the world, and never stopped reading. I ended up here, now, and still keep reading, but now I read more widely and variously than ever before, because of the Web. I believe what my friend <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2012/oct/lessons-from-brooklyn-beta">Chris Shiflett believes</a>, that &#8216;The Internet is the opportunity of our generation.&#8217; I believe that our work building the Web can contribute. I believe human beings are fundamentally good. I&#8217;m not sure how that will manifest itself, but I believe that if we remove the stress we may find out. I believe we can do it, and I always will.</p>
