Last time we met, I talked about the question, [“What’s your favorite
website”](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/jenn-lukas/2012-july-3/). I suppose it’s only fair if
I share mine. 

For a long time running it was Flickr. The interface is easy to understand. Subtle interactions let you edit a
photo without interrupting the work flow. The copy was friendly and inviting. I still love Flickr, but
recently I’ve become in total like with Tumblr.  

I first tried Tumblr in 2008. And then again in 2009. And then, why not, in 2011. As you can see:
[http://jennlukas.tumblr.com/archive](http://jennlukas.tumblr.com/archive), I wasn’t too sold.

Recently though, two things happened. The first, I witnessed the customization possibilities when my buds and
I over at the [The Nerdary](http://www.thenerdary.net/) moved our site over to Tumblr.

Secondly, I like many of us lovers of the internet, occasionally come up with a smart (or really dumb) idea
for a site that seems really funny and/or clever at the moment, but I’m always road blocked by the task
of developing a full site. I decided that mocking the show [Game of
Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)) was more important than custom design and
code. So using Tumblr, I had a [site that made my coworkers
laugh](http://sexhobbit.tumblr.com/post/26909134593/jon-snow-original-emo-kid) up in 5 minutes.

Giving people the ability to create and publish quickly while also allowing them to customize that content to
the depths they wish with ease is not an easy feat. Tumblr allows computer users of all varying skill levels
to be authors of the web and that really, really rules.
