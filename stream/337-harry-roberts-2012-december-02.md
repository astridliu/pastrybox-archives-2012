Get a [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) account, seriously. Since getting that ability to try things out
instantly I have tinkered way, way more and built so many more cool things. If you want to get better, always
tinker; if you want to tinker, make it easy to do. jsfiddle is to a front-end developer what a sketchbook is
to an artist.
