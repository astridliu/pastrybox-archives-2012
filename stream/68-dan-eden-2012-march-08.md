Something I've always found handy to keep in mind is this: *You are your most important, most fun, most
critical, and best client*.Â As important as client work can be, there's nothing like a personal project that
you feel passionate about to get your creative juices flowing, and to help you unlock a lot of untapped
potential for future work. Whether it's a redesign for your blog, or a fully fledged web application, or a CSS
animation framework - nothing pays off quite like a personal project.

People could love it or hate it, criticize or praise it, use it or ignore it - it doesn't matter. If it
fulfills your own needs, or puts a smile on your face, or gives you something to be proud of - that's the most
important thing. You are your own favorite client. I cannot stress that enough.
