I always have something to do. "In my free time" is just a joke I sometimes mutter to myself. Without proper
ways to manage that, I'd go crazy.

Though it seems like overkill, I use a system of loose and strict to-dos to help me get through my day. For
starters, I use [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) (synced to iPhone and iPad through
[Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/)) to record my random thoughts. I've been sprinkling
[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) into that mix, but haven't quite found a reliable reason for it yet. Once
something from those lists are actionable, I'll move it into topic-based lists in
[Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) (as a [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) app). Lastly, when I'm at a list to
move it into a daily list, it goes into my trusty [TeuxDeux](http://teuxdeux.com/) (also as a Fluid app).

That's how I get things done.
