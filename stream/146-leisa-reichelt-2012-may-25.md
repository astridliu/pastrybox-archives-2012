When I was younger, my mother always told me ‘don’t worry what other people think’. I always
thought that was pretty good advice but lately I’ve decided it was pretty flawed.

What other people think does matter, sometimes it’s really important. Blinkering yourself to that can
cut off your ability to empathise and to respond appropriately.

Now I’m a mother, the message I want to send might be something about finding the value in the things
you do that makes you different and really embracing it. Understand yourself better, and understand others as
much as you can.
