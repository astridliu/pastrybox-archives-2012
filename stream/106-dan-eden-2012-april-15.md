We web folk have an incredible advantage. We have an infinite canvas; one which can be stretched and bent to
our will. We make up the rules as we go along. Our future is uncertain, and our past is short. Mistakes can be
changed at the click of a mouse, and no one has the right to judge us - we're all just getting started.

Make mistakes. Embrace the chaos.
