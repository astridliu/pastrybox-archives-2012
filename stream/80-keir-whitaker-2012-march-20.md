We all strive to release "perfect" sites and applications, but sometimes you just have to "ship"! Get it out
there, live with it, gather feedback and then revisit, fix bugs, improve markup and deploy. What other formats
offer us this opportunity? If you are procrastinating on whether your site or side project is finished, I say
just "ship it"!
