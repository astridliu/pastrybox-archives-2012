Do yourself and the internet a favor: make copies of your data. Platforms and services are born every day.
Some die. Some get bought by a company who may or may not care about the quotes you’ve lovingly
collected, the check-ins you’ve made, or the photos you’ve taken. Be aware. The web is ephemeral.
Things change. Links break. If you care about your data, back it up.
