I was reading a book recently and came across a passage in which a man was returning to the place where he
grew up as a child. The author summed up the character’s feelings perfectly
—

> “he felt like a ghost haunting his own
> past”

It instantly struck a chord with me because it’s exactly how I feel when I look back at code I wrote
last year, 6 months ago or even last week. We’re always learning, always improving and being our own
worst critiques. In my opinion that’s the way it should be.
