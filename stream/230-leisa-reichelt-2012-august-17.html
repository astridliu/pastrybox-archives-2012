       <blockquote><p>It must be borne in mind that the object being worked on is going to be ridden in, sat upon, looked at, talked into, activated, operated, or in some way used by people individually or en masse. If the point of contact between the product and people becomes a point of friction, then the designer has failed. If, on the other hand, people are made safer, more comfortable, more desirous of purchase, more efficient—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded.</p></blockquote><p>—Henry Dreyfuss, <cite>Harvard Business Review</cite>, November 1950</p><p>Those are exciting times, and we’re tackling new and different challenges. Yet Dreyfuss wrote this homage to user experience 62 years ago.</p><p>We have a heritage of great designers trying to make great user experiences in the face of rapidly changing technology. User Experience may be a new(ish) term, but Human Factors is a well-established profession. Apple may be our current commercial successful design-focused poster company but Dreyfuss demonstrated for decades that good design was commercially rewarding.</p><p>Our technology and buzzwords might be new but the challenges we face are, at least, decades old.</p><p>Let’s seek out this legacy and draw inspiration from it more deeply. Let’s learn from history rather than endlessly learn things anew. Let’s stop thinking we’re so clever for thinking thoughts that others have thought decades before us and knuckle down the real challenge of creating environments where good design can thrive. A challenge that hasn’t, and probably won’t soon, go away.</p>
