I’m feeling reflective this morning and no it’s not the silver jump suit I just happen to be wearing.

I’ve been wondering how I’ve arrived at where I am at this point in my life. In part, I have to attribute
some of my success to the people that went before as there are some very clever people around involved in this
“web design business”. Where would we be without them? 

A number of them give their time, energy and commitment for free or often for little reward. 

They’ve spent hours squashing bugs, fixing layouts, documenting problems, raising standards or just helping
out lesser mortals when they can. It’s this selfless but driven approach that makes this “web community”
an interesting community to be a part of and helps us all to raise the barriers that we set for ourselves.


We can all be taller if we stand on the shoulders of giants, and I just wanted to say thanks to all of you
that have taught me so much.
