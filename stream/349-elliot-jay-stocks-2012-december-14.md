Do you ever hear a song that takes you back to a particular moment in time? Opening notes or chords so deeply
ingrained in your subconscious that you can almost ‘become’ a past version of yourself in an instant? I
can think of a few songs that have that effect on me and most are seasonal. This time of year, December
specifically, there’s a song that’s been playing in my head since I was 15. That song
is [‘Thirty-Three’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Three_(song)) by The Smashing Pumpkins
([Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/00V8OQOPSvaA9Sl3FxhiCw)/ [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/artist/The_Smashing_Pumpkins/album/Mellon_Collie_And_The_Infinite_Sadness/track/Thirty-Three/) / [YouTube](http://youtu.be/AYSbztCCTlA)).

So I’m 15 again. Christmas 1996 is approaching. On my Christmas list is [‘Melon Collie and The Infinite
Sadness’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_Collie_and_the_Infinite_Sadness), the Pumpkins’ epic
landmark two-disc album. ‘Thirty-Three’ is a song on disc two, but at this point I’ve yet to hear it —
I have to wait until Christmas Day for that. But here I am on a cold Saturday morning, thumbing through CDs in
a small independent (and ultimately doomed) record store in my hometown of Orpington, Kent, about to hear the
song for the first time. In the ‘singles’ section, ‘Thirty-Three’ is a new release. There are two
versions available, each with different b-sides. I buy [the
version](http://discogs.com/Smashing-Pumpkins-Thirty-Three/release/1120726) that includes ‘The Last
Song’ — an absolutely beautiful track that features a guitar solo from Billy Corgan’s father — ‘The
Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)’, and ‘Transformer’.

Of the days that followed that purchase, I have no specific memory. I assume I played the single a lot —
especially the first two songs — in the run-up to Christmas, and I know that I did indeed receive the full
album on Christmas Day. But the specifics are irrelevant: the residual feeling is what mattered (to me, at
least).

At that time in my life, I’d recently broken up with my first girlfriend and, being a rather emotional and
— let’s face it — somewhat pathetic fifteen year-old (long before the term ‘emo’ was coined, of
course), life was filled with a sense of bittersweet melancholy, fueled by the discovery of music that remains
poignant to this day. Life also had an air of innocence: I lived at home with my parents, I was mid-way
through high school, and I’d yet to start my first job. The web had just started to turn into ‘a thing’,
but I wasn’t aware of it.

This little bout of reminiscing has no point. There’s no deeper meaning hidden behind the story of me buying
‘Thirty-Three’ just over half my life ago. The number is not even relevant to my age (I won’t be
thirty-three for another couple of years yet). It’s simply that I’ve been asked to provide a thought for
December, and this is what’s in my head. ‘Thirty-Three’ is playing on perpetual internal repeat because
it’s cold and it’s December and Christmas is approaching. And all of those factors combined offer me a
gateway back to 1996.

That’s been the case every year since I first heard that song. I wonder if that’ll always be the case?
