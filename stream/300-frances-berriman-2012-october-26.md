This month, our team did the first non-beta release of our new site,[www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk/).

We’ve been very careful to refer to it as a release, rather than alaunch. Launching insinuates a thing
is done—that we’ve set our boat off to sail and don’t intend to think about it again. A launch
succeeds or fails, with not a lot in between. However, it’s not until after a launch that our real users
get to be onboard and find all the snags and pitfalls. Those are the people we’ve been spending so much
time thinking about—it’s short-sighted of us to imagine that we’d be able to guess how
they’ll inevitably be using the site in anger.

User testing can only get so far and now we’re excited to learn how the rest of the world reacts to our
release so we can improve in the next one.
