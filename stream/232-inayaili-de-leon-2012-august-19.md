Reading The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki, I came upon (amongst many others) an interesting topic:
collaboration between scientists, how sharing is such an important part of their careers and their success.
How even though each scientist pursues individual recognition, that can’t be achieved alone. How papers
are signed by 400 scientists, and how the most prominent scientists are also the ones who work with others
more frequently. I wonder if there’s something about this way of sharing knowledge and working together
that we could learn from and extrapolate for our own disciplines.
