Itâ€™s great to see that
[Opera](http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2012/08/10/css-vendor-prefixes-in-opera-12-50-snapshots),
[Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/aurora-16-is-out/) and [Internet
Explorer](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx)
are removing support for vendor prefixes on stable CSS properties.

Vendor prefixes are like [skidmarks](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=skidmarks) on the
underwear of web standards: sometimes unavoidable, but best washed and rinsed out as soon as possible.
