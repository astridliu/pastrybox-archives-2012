We're given mounds of data when all we want is the answer to a question: Which car should I buy? What's the
best treatment for this illness? Which software will be best for my business? Instead of answers, we get
search results, lists, spreadsheets, dashboards and other collections of data that do nothing to help us with
the sense-making process.  And while more and more data is made available to us, our capacity to hold these
ideas in short-term memory has not changed. We need tools to help offload the mental tasks of understanding
and identifying relationships. Why? So that our short-term working memory is free to make better, more
informed judgments.

Data visualization is a step in the right direction, but these impressive feats of engineering tend to
overwhelm most people. And infographics, while great for engaging people emotionally and making sense of a
complex topic, are designed for print and not sufficient for large, dynamic datasets. We need something
in-between, something engaging and dynamic, some visual representation designed around the content it is meant
to serve. Shopping for a point and click camera? Why settle for search results or a data grid? Why not show
dozens of options arranged in such a way as to reveal something each camera relative to the other choices?
What might this screen look like? Moreover, what will the Web look like as we start to pay attention to the
content being served up by these decade old UI patterns?

For this to happen, we need skilled visual designers—those individuals who excel at communicating ideas in
powerful ways—who are also excited to work with content that is liquid and unpredictable. This is still a
new set of skills, but a set of skills that will be in high demand as we look for new ways to deal with too
much information and a shortage of clear answers.
