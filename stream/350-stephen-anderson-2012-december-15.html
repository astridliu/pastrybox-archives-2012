    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>A few years ago, I started adding a rather odd section to my proposals. In addition to the usual stuff (who I am, their problem, what I&#8217;m proposing, pricing, and so on), I added a section entitled:</p><p>&#8220;Questions I&#8217;m Curious to Explore (Why this is personally exciting!)&#8221;</p><p>I did this for two reasons:</p><p>One, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to demonstrate that your interest in working with them is about more than the money. Letting potential clients know that you&#8217;re really excited about the problem space, and why, is a great way to set yourself apart from other proposals they may be entertaining.</p><p>Two, this was a good filter for me, personally. Answering the question &#8220;why do I want this project?&#8221; forces you to look beyond financial compensation. I&#8217;m keenly aware of how the projects I choose to invest my time in, in turn either advance, hinder, or alter my own learning trajectory. I&#8217;d like to be intentional about the work I choose — not just for what it is, but how it affects me: Emotionally. Financially. Timewise. What will I learn and who will I meet? What will I bring into the world? How will this affect people? And how does this play into my personal narrative? Put into perspective, a six month project is a good chunk of my life. I want to live my life with intention. I&#8217;ve turned down work — good work — because it didn&#8217;t pass the &#8220;Questions I&#8217;m Curious to Explore&#8221; test.</p><p>For the projects I do work on, once I&#8217;m a few weeks or months deep, it&#8217;s a nice reminder — especially when things are tense — of what I (personally) hoped to get out of this investment of my time. I can re-evaluate: Is what I wrote down still important? Are we on track? Am I learning new things that I didn&#8217;t anticipate? </p><p>Of course, being able to complete a &#8220;Questions I&#8217;m Curious to Explore&#8221; section means there&#8217;s already a bank of things you want to learn more about, whether it&#8217;s new skills, something you&#8217;d like to test, or something else. </p><p>One theme that&#8217;s emerged for me over the last year is just how import learning, discovery, play — being curious — is for me. This is a theme I&#8217;ve seen show up again in again each post I wrote and each presentation I gave. I value curiosity, a lot. Not just for me, but for everyone. As a species, we are born curious. We are hardwired to grow and discover the world around us. </p><p>So I&#8217;d like to ask you a question:</p><p>&#8220;What are you curious about? What do you want to know more about by this time next year?&#8221;</p><p>Whether it&#8217;s related to your work, or some personal interest, write down something (or a bunch of somethings!) you&#8217;re curious about. And then, pursue that topic to the point of exhaustion. Make something based on what you&#8217;re learning. Share what you&#8217;re learning with others. Engage in conversations about what you&#8217;re learning. You&#8217;ll discover a quiet kind of satisfaction that comes from a challenge faced, and mastered. </p><p>What are you curious about?</p>
