Each new app kickstarts the race to state an opinion. By the end of the day, the app has been hailed as the
dizzying future or decried as a #fail-hashtagged folly. Entire industries have been deemed moribund or
reinvigorated, and life will never be the same again.

First impressions are valuable, but theyâ€™re unreliable, too easily seduced by visceral tricks:
appearances, implications, promises. Products should be experienced over time, with context, sobriety, and
occasional tipsiness. Only once a product has started to wear a groove in our lives can we genuinely claim to
understand what it means.
