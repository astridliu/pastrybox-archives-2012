You know that thing where you’ve carefully crafted your markup, the content is well written, etc. Then
the day before go live you hear “I don’t like x, change it.” It’s from the chief exec
of said large corporation that you have no access to to explain the user journeys or rationale and nor does
your client. Yeah that.

I feel your pain.
