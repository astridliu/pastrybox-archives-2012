       <p>If you&#8217;ve ever read Alice in Wonderland, you&#8217;ll be familiar with the following passage:</p><blockquote class="no-quotes smaller-text full-width"><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll take you with pleasure!&#8221; the Queen said. &#8220;Two pence a week, and jam every other day.&#8221;</p><p>Alice couldn&#8217;t help laughing, as she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to hire ME—and I don&#8217;t care for jam.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good jam,&#8221; said the Queen.</p><p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want any TO-DAY, at any rate.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have it if you DID want it,&#8221; the Queen said. &#8220;The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—but never jam to-day.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It MUST come sometimes to &#8216;jam to-day&#8217;,&#8221; Alice objected.</p><p>&#8220;No, it can&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;It&#8217;s jam every OTHER day: to-day isn&#8217;t any OTHER day, you know.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_tomorrow">— from <cite>Through the Looking Glass & What Alice Found There</cite>, by Lewis Carroll</a></p><p>Let&#8217;s say that you, in fact, <em>liked</em> jam, and that&#8217;s exactly what you wanted. Some of us (myself a primary culprit) have lived or are living in the world of &#8220;jam every other day&#8221; with &#8220;today not being any OTHER day&#8221;. That is to say, we&#8217;ve lived or are living with extreme delayed gratification, to the point where there is no gratification at all, or if it is, it is extremely short-lived and difficult to appreciate.</p><p>What are you putting off until it&#8217;s &#8220;the right time&#8221;, such as the project (an article or book to write, app to develop; site, program or company to launch), that you really want to do, something new that you really want to learn, a fun new activity that you really want to try, a new exercise habit, a vacation or trip that you really want to take, the person (or people) that you would like to get to know better/spend more time with or become friends with? What piece or pieces of self-care are you pushing off because &#8220;you don&#8217;t have time&#8221;? In my own life, I can see so many times where &#8220;jam to-morrow&#8221; just didn&#8217;t happen—largely due to my own devices. In contrast, during the instances where I did get, achieve, or manifest what I truly desired, I was in-love with life and all of the possibilities that it had to offer.</p><p>So, if it&#8217;s &#8220;jam every other day&#8221; for you like it has been for me so often in my life, here is my recommendation based on what I&#8217;m currently learning and putting into practice: start looking at where you can make it &#8220;jam today&#8221; instead. Right now, I am making an effort to set aside small amounts of time to do the hard work (only because I am out of practice) of feeding my soul, and am trusting that it becomes increasingly easier the more I do it. I&#8217;ve already seen that when you give to yourself first, you then are able to give more to the world. And isn&#8217;t that what we all came here for anyway?</p><p>(…and if you&#8217;re curious, my favorite jam to date is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dalfour-Fancy-Plum-Fruit-Ounces/dp/B007YAO8DO">St. Dalfour Fancy Plum</a>. Yum!)</p>
