My favorite question to ask in an interview is “what have you built recently just for fun?”. I
don’t really care what it is they built. I’m just looking for people, like me, that live and
breathe frontend so much that even when the work day is done, their brain is still working and coming up with
ideas. It’s clichéd but true that you should love what you do and do what you love. You might not have
the job you want right now, but the real question is do you have the passion to do the work that will get you
to your dream job one day?
