    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>Recently I worked on the redesign of <a href="http://happycog.com/">happycog.com</a>. We planned, designed and coded the whole site in one 5 day work week and published it on that Friday, even with some bugs still showing. As a part-time perfectionist, the applauded philosophy of releasing early and often has always seemed a bit horrifying to me. Are you really going to let people see your code before you have quality assured it till your eyes can't blink anymore? Gasp! It's a formalists nightmare. </p><p>After we launched, it took just a few minutes for the first piece of twitter feedback to come in, alerting us of to one of those remaining bugs. My first instinct was to put down my celebratory beverage, run back to Coda, and start fixing things. And then something crazy happened. It might've been that my brain was working on 6 hours of sleep over 3 days, but instead of firing up my mobile emulators, I closed my laptop. I decided to embrace that we tried an experiment on our own company site, knew there'd be bugs and in time, they'd be fixed. A JavaScript bug in Safari wasn't going to be the end of the world and it won't be on your site either, unless you're working on a site that is teaching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(1998_film)">Bruce Willis how to disarm an Asteroid</a>. </p><p>We've all been under tight deadlines and might not have had the time to test Opera for the 22nd time and sometimes it's 4 am and we forget to also add a :focus rule to our :hover declaration. In this big internet family we all are, a lot of folks genuinely want to help each other out and help you identify these items.  If the attitude is "we are all in this together", then that's another great thing we have going for us. </p><p>The idea of social bug reporting can be really great. Two things to remember: </p><ul><li>Keep a thick skin and take feedback with a grain of salt, while giving yourself a pat on the back for all the hard work you've put in up to this point.</li><li>Give feedback with grace and don't forget there are people behind those anonymous functions. </li></ul>
