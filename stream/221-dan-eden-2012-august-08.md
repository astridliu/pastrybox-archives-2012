Everything is designed. Every single thing. Once you get that idea in your head, it’s a hard one to get
out. We see the world differently once we make that connection. We think about the decisions that led to the
object we’re admiring or scrutinising. Who was it who decided the width of a mug handle? The diameter of
the mug itself? Who decided on the material used to produce the mug? Was it cheaper than a superior
alternative? All these questions and more apply to everything we see around us. The depth of a plank of wood.
The particular shade of yellow on a PostIt. The length of a descender on a lowercase ‘p’.

Even things out of our hands. The veins in the leaves on a tree. The color of our skies. The molecular
structure of oxygen. I’m not a religious man by any stretch of the imagination, but I find the idea that
those things happened by chance quite an uncomfortable one. There’s some comfort in the thought that a
person made the decisions about these things. We live in a man-made world. A designed world. Nature—it would
appear—designed itself, mostly. I digress.

Every choice we make—or more importantly, don’t actively make—is reflected in our work in a big way,
for potentially years to come. People will see the work you produce and spend hours pondering over why you
chose to use a particular color. I know because I am that person. You probably are as well. This reminds me of
some very wise words from the Eames’ office—The details are not the details. They are the design.

We must remain mindful of our decisions. We must question our decisions, and the decisions of others, in order
to innovate, reinvent, and make better. We must encourage others to do the same—not just fellow designers
but those we encounter every day—friends and family. The old and young, blind and deaf, and everyone in
between. You work for them. They are your audience. Delight them. Impress them. Above all, make their lives
better. That’s what we do. We make better. We design.
