I think the rise of code education sites on the web is super radical. Even Kahn Academy has just added a
[Computer Science section](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs). Iâ€™ve recently been reading a lot about
[Problem Based Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning) and I think incorporating some
of the techniques used in PBL and providing real use cases for learning code would make these code education
sites appeal to an even wider audience.
