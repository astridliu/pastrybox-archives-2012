really been speaking to me lately:

> Darkness hoveringGrasping everything it seesVoid
> emptyAbsent life and absent dream
> Let there be
> Angels toil and crack open scrolls of ancient dreamsCountless worlds of hisBrilliant stars and breath and
> stream
> Let there be (light)
> Where there is darknessLet there be lightWhere there is nothingLet there be light
