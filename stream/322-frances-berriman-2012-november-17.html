    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>After the launch of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gov.uk/">www.gov.uk</a>, the coverage we were most excited about was that in the printed press, particularly those found in glossy design magazines. This is not to say that we didn&rsquo;t have any other kind of press online, just that this was a particular type that seemed to garner the most respect, despite our remit being &ldquo;digital by default&rdquo;.</p><p>Be it an article in a magazine or a complete, published, book, many of us are still swayed to believe that the printed medium is somehow better, more&nbsp;tangible&nbsp;and respectable. &nbsp;That an author has more of value to say if it&rsquo;s printed on paper rather than accessible purely digitally. Why is this? &nbsp;Is it not part of our remit as digital citizens to encourage less wasteful and informationally accurate consumerism?</p><p>Printing digitally comes with so many benefits: you can update information with corrections, annotations, further information. &nbsp;Digital can be interactive, more easily shared and produced in a wider number of languages more easily. It can take unusual forms, and it can be more accessible. Yet still, many of us are excited or prefer a physical book, fixed in time and would consider the printed version superior.</p><p>Is it the additional effort associated with physical print that gives it its significance? &nbsp;Something that&nbsp;cost more money to produce, could last longer, can be touched and shared, and is not necessarily &ldquo;of web&rdquo;. How or will we recreate these properties of value in digital medium, or will the special place that paper holds for many of us eventually disappear naturally?</p>
