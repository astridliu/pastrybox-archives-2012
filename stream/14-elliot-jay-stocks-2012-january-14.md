The start of a new year is always a good time to re-evaluate everything we do. How can we use the coming
months to make things better? Better for us individually. Better for the wider web community. Better for end
users.

In our lovely, friendly industry, a lot is said about the latter two, but not so much about the former... and
it's a shame. Why shouldn't we put effort into improving things for ourselves, so that we're happier? Not to
the detriment of others, of course, but there's no harm in wanting to enjoy ones work.

For me personally, I've had a great 2011, but it still came with its fair share of stress,
good-projects-gone-bad, difficult clients, and relatively frequent late nights. My goal for 2012, then, is to
right those wrongs; to prevent those scenarios from ever occurring, and learning to deal with them more
effectively if they do. [I've written about my plans on my
blog](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/viewport-industries-and-the-2012-experiment/) and the gist is that I'm
temporarily giving up client work to focus on making my own products. This comes from a desire to be happier.
Again, it's okay to have this desire, as long as it's not at the expense of others.

This process of re-evaluation will continue throughout the next year, as products are released, and in one
year's time, I'll be looking back to see if my '2012 experiment' did indeed bring me more pleasure. If not,
it'll be time to re-evaluate once again. And that's okay.
