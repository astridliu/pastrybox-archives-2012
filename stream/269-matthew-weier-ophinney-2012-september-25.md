I’ve felt honored and somewhat amused to be a part of the Pastry Box Project. As I look around at my
fellow bakers, I find that the majority are designers and usability gurus. I sit at the other end of the
spectrum when it comes to user interactions — the work I do is on the server side, handling the incoming
requests and providing responses; only the side effects of my work are seen by the end user, and often those
are filtered through visual design I never touch.

And yet, I’d argue there’s another level of design that happens in this arena. The code written
must be readable and maintainable, both by myself in the future as well as others. The interactions between
different code responsibilities must be clear and concise, and readily understood. The class names and methods
should communicate their purpose.

It’s tremendously easy and seductive to be able to write a few, quick lines of code that get the job
done. It’s a more interesting and rewarding job to make functional code self-documenting and
maintainable.

Code requires good design, too.
