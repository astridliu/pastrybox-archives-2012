    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>Recently over lunch, the hypothetical question of "If you could have lunch with anyone in the world" who would it be came to discussion. I racked my brain and disposed of the "too smart, it would be intimidating" entries (like Bill Gates) and the "I'm only lunching with you cause you're hot" entries (like Joseph Gordon Levitt) and ended up on someone who I thought I could relate with and learn from, Tina Fey. Tina Fey/Liz Lemon and I share three important similarities: </p><ol><li>We were both the first femail directors at our jobs. Her as the head writer of Saturday Night Live, me as the Interactive Development Director at Happy Cog.</li><li>We both accrue lettuce in our hair as a result of eating at our desks.</li><li>We both have dated a beeper salesman.</li></ol><p>If you're waiting for the comic relief in which I say only one of these three facts is true, you'll be waiting a while. I never really put much thought into any of these, as they all really just seem like an integral part of life, but recently the first one has been on my mind. After reading about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/virginia-rometty/">Virgina Rometty</a> being named CEO of IBM, I got to thinking, "that's awesome! But why does it matter that she's the first?" </p><p>My thoughts on that were further solidified after watching <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/1645426185#">Tina Fey's acceptance speech for the Mark Twain award</a> in which she said:</p><blockquote><p>Apparently, I’m only the third woman ever to receive this award, and I’m so honored to – to – to be numbered with Lilly Tomlin and Whoopi Goldberg, but I do hope that women are achieving at a rate these days that we can stop counting what number they are things.</p></blockquote><p>I really dig that women in technology is gaining momentum as a topic. I loved teaching <a href="http://thenerdary.net/articles/entry/girl-develop-it-philadelphia">the first Philly chapter of Girl Develop It</a>. I've also enjoyed reading the tweets from <a href="http://gracehopper.org/2011/">the 11th Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</a>. I hope these groups supportive of women tech nerds keep on coming. I hope that they become so prominent that we slowly don't need them anymore and like the real Liz Lemon says, that we'll be able to soon stop the counting.</p>
