—Henry Dreyfuss, Harvard Business Review, November 1950

Those are exciting times, and we’re tackling new and different challenges. Yet Dreyfuss wrote this homage to
user experience 62 years ago.

We have a heritage of great designers trying to make great user experiences in the face of rapidly changing
technology. User Experience may be a new(ish) term, but Human Factors is a well-established profession. Apple
may be our current commercial successful design-focused poster company but Dreyfuss demonstrated for decades
that good design was commercially rewarding.

Our technology and buzzwords might be new but the challenges we face are, at least, decades old.

Let’s seek out this legacy and draw inspiration from it more deeply. Let’s learn from history rather than
endlessly learn things anew. Let’s stop thinking we’re so clever for thinking thoughts that others have
thought decades before us and knuckle down the real challenge of creating environments where good design can
thrive. A challenge that hasn’t, and probably won’t soon, go away.
