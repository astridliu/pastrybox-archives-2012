       <p>"Responsive Web Design". A phrase we're all familiar with thanks to the wonderful work of Ethan Marcotte.</p><p>But quite frankly though, I am bored of hearing it.</p><p>It's not like I don't like the phrase, in fact it's quite the opposite. It describes its function perfectly. There is also no doubt we need to continue exploring the shift towards responsive web design while continuing to refine our techniques and methodologies. However, this is just one of the many challenges we face many in the crazy faced paced world of the web.</p><p>So what's my point? Well, what I'd really like to see in the coming months and years is to hear about people following a similar path to the one trodden by Ethan. I want to hear about new discoveries and in turn, the definition of new phrases & terms that describe our methods, techniques and working practices. Rather than every blog article repeating and quoting each other, let's push ourselves to break new ground and define a new lexicon of language for the web in order for us grow into a mature, independent medium.</p><p>It's time to cast away our relationships with other industries such as print and shape our own future. Like a child learning to talk, web design has learned a few words - now it's time to expand her vocabulary.</p>
