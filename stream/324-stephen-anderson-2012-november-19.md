# On Formal Training and Discovery

Like many who have come into this thing known as “UX,” I’ve never had any formal training.
Except for a few art and design classes at my University (back when graphic design meant cutting ruby sheets
by hand!), I’ve never been trained in web design, information architecture, usability, psychology, data
visualization, product strategy… Everything I know I’ve picked up on projects, through a lot of
reading and experimentation, and by working with lots of varied and talented people. At times, I’ve
struggled with this lack of training, asking myself “Am I a fraud?” or “Am I going about things
in the right way?” And I’ve certainly been jealous of those younger than me who’ve been able to
take brilliant and inspiring courses from MIT, Stanford, or Carnegie Mellon. But… I’ve come to realize
that it is precisely this lack of formal training, combined with a natural curiosity, that has led me to
invent my own ways of doing things and form my own opinions about things. A reliance on a perceived
“authority” can actually create blind spots in our thinking. We don’t see opportunities, or
worse— we dismiss them before they have a chance to introduce themselves.

Creative ideas happen through unexpected combinations: someone formally trained in film becomes a certified
chef so he can create [a new kind of cooking show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Eats). Someone else
decides to chart his health patterns not with charts and graphs, but with [a data visualization he designs
based on patterns in nature](http://www.slideshare.net/mprove/ixd12denman). We tend to think in particular
ways and in a particular direction — often the one taught to us. But, history shows us that both incremental
and giant leaps forward happen at the intersection of different — seemingly unrelated — ideas.

I’m finally coming to realize the upside to not having been formally trained in anything I do; I might
even say I’m proud of the fact that I’ve had no formal training or certifications. It’s the
discovery mindset that allows us to combine and create new things, things that in many cases go on to become
“how things are done.” But hear me on this: How things are done is we listen, observe, draw on our
experiences (and those around us) to identify and solve real problems. How things are done is not about the
resulting processes and tools that we see coming out of the very real process of inquiry. How things are done
starts with curiosity.

By coming at things sideways, without the safe rails of training, I’ve been forced to explore uncharted
spaces, creating along the way my own map of the landscape. I’ve never known to not combine things in a
certain way or that a particular tool is the “right” one for the job. I get to make stuff up as I
go along! And since I’m always learning, I guess I’m always making stuff up. In truth, we all are,
or all should be. 

At this point, rather than envy, I pity those who are trained in the “right way” to do things. It’s
difficult to see things from different perspectives when you’ve decided–consciously or
unconsciously–to follow a particular path through and around a problem space. For a field as nascent as
ours, there is no right way to do things. We’re all stumbling into the future.
