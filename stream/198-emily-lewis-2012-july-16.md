When I decided to work for myself, a part of me envisioned all the extra free time I would have. Two years
into it, I definitely don’t have more free time. I’m working harder than I ever have, and
I’m involved in more projects than ever before.

I often work long hours. I don’t typically take a traditional weekend off. I sometimes even work
holidays. It isn’t exactly what I expected. It’s actually better.

I’m more productive than I’ve ever been with work. I never responded well to a Monday–Friday,
9–5 week. So much of what I do is creative in nature, and sometimes I just can’t force it. Rather than
sitting behind a desk, wasting hours feeling frustrated and stagnant, I now get chores done, read a book or go
for a walk. And because I work from home, my office is there when the productivity bug strikes.

Not only can I work when I want, I work where I want. Sometimes it’s the local coffee shop. Sometimes
it’s the hotel room when I’m at a conference. Sometimes it’s my sister’s house in
Charlottesville or my best friend’s condo in Seattle. I have freedom to go where I want and still be
responsible for my business.

My days feel more balanced. I wake when I want (or, rather, when the cats want to be fed). I have time to
exercise and get outside before I even turn on the computer. I have weekly appointments that I don’t
have to book months in advance, because I’m available the middle of the day. I bypass crowded grocery
stores because I can hit Trader Joe’s when no one else is there.

No, working for myself, I don’t have more free time. I have more quality of time.
