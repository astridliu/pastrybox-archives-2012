I had a discussion recently with an old friend over dinner about the whole concept of “luck.” Me, I’ve
always felt incredibly lucky. I’ve been given many opportunities over my career: getting a good job; working
with rather fantastic clients; speaking at conferences; writing an article and, eventually, a book I’m
especially excited about. I like to think I’m a hard worker, sure, but I’ve been handed some remarkable
opportunities by even more remarkable individuals. I’m really fortunate.

My friend had a slightly different take. She doesn’t believe in luck, or at least, not as such. Instead, she
felt it’s a matter of working hard, of earning the work you’re given, and—this is the important bit—of
agreeing to projects that leave you *open* to other, new opportunities.

I don’t know who’s right; hell, it was just an idle dinner conversation. (And an enjoyable one at that.)
But my gut says we’re both right, or at least half-right. Maybe it’s not *just* about stumbling into new
opportunities, but working hard enough so that you’re recognized for your efforts. And conversely, it’s
not *just* about preserving your work ethic, but acknowledging, and being thankful to, the people who extend a
helping hand your way.

I’m not sure. But I do think it’s worth taking a moment here and there to extend a little luck toward
those that haven’t found any yet.
