This last year of Pastry Box thoughts started with a [story of a letter written by a 10-year-old
girl](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/jon-tan/2012-january-6/). A letter that was discovered by her son over
a hundred years later when he was an old man. It was about the intimacy across time between them, and how
seeing the shape of her writing somehow gave me a sense of knowing her a little, too.

I think intimacy is something we strive for, and as designers we facilitate with our work. From projecting a
simple message about a product into the minds of our audience, to helping people reach across time and
distance to share an experience, intimacy is our business. To do it, we work on our own capacity for empathy.
We design for other people, and in trying to do so put ourselves behind their eyes, under their fingertips,
and project ourselves into their experiences. Maybe that’s why many designers seem so liberal to me.
Liberal in the literal sense of generous and open, for the most part.

This month is the festive season, the season of goodwill; a celebration. I’m not religious. I’m a
[secular humanist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism) if anything. For me the festive season is a
celebration of our human capacity to be inherently ethical and moral without religion. Part of that is
recognising my own good fortune, and celebrating the inherent goodness in all of us. It’s the season
where I try to refresh my own empathy and compassion, and try to hold on to that for the coming year, as a
human, father, husband, and designer. I hope you feel somewhat similar. Thank you for giving me your time when
you read my thoughts this year.

May the best of your past be the worst of your future!
