# Why prototyping beats wireframing.

 *  You’re making, not documenting. You can feel the thing you’re making.

 *  You’ve got a thing you can start testing, in all kinds of ways, almost immediately. Prototyping is
more like experimenting than describing your grand design.

 *  It doesn’t have to look good to be effective. It’s easier to keep it rough which helps people
give better feedback early on.

 *  You start out with the barest structure of an idea and gradually build in the detail as you play with and
test out the thing you have made.

 *  You’re learning useful things (like how to better translate your ideas into code).

 *  Stakeholders and clients get excited about prototypes in a way they never do about wireframes.

 *  Prototypes are concrete where wireframes are abstract.

 *  Prototypes create the impression of real progress—of something actually happening—in a way that wire
framing never does.

 *  Prototyping is addictive—you have to pull yourself away from it (rather than forcing yourself to stay in
your chair and finish annotating your wireframes).

 *  Prototyping encourages cross-disciplinary teams from the earliest stages of design. You get to work with
smart people who can make your work better.

 *  If you’re on a project where you feel like you *have* to wireframe extensively, there’s
probably a better way to be doing that project.

Less wireframing, more prototyping.
