Personally, I am making an effort to incorporate more of a sense of play into my work. If there is no sense of
fun or joy in what you do, then you may be doing the wrong thing. In my experience, it takes a lot of
deliberate thought to challenge cultural norms and common beliefs to allow ourselves to find that work doesn't
have to be hard – that it can be play – and to start structuring our work and lives to reflect this.

The sense of play and joy always shines through a website or a product – channeling that sort of positivity
will only help to continue making the web a better place.
