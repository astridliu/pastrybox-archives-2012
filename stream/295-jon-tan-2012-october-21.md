I grew up in the middle of the UK in the 70s and 80s reading authors like Tolkien, Asimov, and Dumas.
Dumas’s adventure via adversity stories were a band-aid for the almost-daily racial slights of school
life at the time. Asimov’s grandeur distracted me from feeling dislocated at the irrelevant fact of me
being mixed race. Tolkien’s nobility sustained me as I helped my Mum run a one-parent family.

When I was the age my eldest son is now, my father would cane me for staying up late reading after bedtime.
Granted, I pretty much ignored his more polite requests, and used to hide under the covers with a torch,
trying to listen out for the creak of his step on the stairs. It was impossible to simultaneously be immersed
in the world on the page, and have the sensory keenness of a sentry in an observation post. My Dad always
managed to catch me. I would grin in embarrassment, and almost admiration at his silent skill. Later, I would
tightly coil up inside with trepidation when I was caught. A caning was my father’s perverse expression
of love, demonstrated by his determination that I should get some sleep so I could concentrate in school. I
needed to concentrate because I needed to do well in school. I needed to do well in school to have a good
life. Education lead to wealth, and that would insulate me from suffering. At least, so he believed. Books
were just too good to resist, though. I was addicted. I took the canings yet still read. My father left soon
after. Books became an escape as well as an addiction.

When I got older I discovered authors like [Kim Stanley Robinson](http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/). His
optimism for the near future was overwhelming. Visions like [Pacific
Edge](http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/w/index.php5?title=Pacific_Edge) may be utopic, but they are seductive
and emblematic. I wanted to live in a world like that of [Blue
Mars](http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/w/index.php5?title=Blue_Mars). I read [Neal
Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/) and marvelled at the erudition of
[Cryptonomicon](http://www.nealstephenson.com/crypt/), and the raw power of [Snow
Crash](http://www.nealstephenson.com/snowcrash/). I wanted to know the things he and his characters knew.

I started to realise that I was an optimist, too. I had to be, because my disquiet at the world around me gave
me scant choice. I had to believe in our innate humanity and potential for empathy, compassion, and goodness.
I started to believe that if you remove the suffering and stress from people’s lives, the vast majority
of people would do right by their fellow humans. I believed in Kim Stanley Robinson’s vision for a future
where a revolution by law and evolution in technology would remove suffering. I believed that characters like
[Hiro Protagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Condensed_narrative), even if they were outside
conventional power structures, could help bring that about. I think I know and work with some of his
real-world avatars today.

The faith and optimism of my core beliefs are one of the reasons why I do what I do. I never did stop reading.
I left university early, and didn’t stop reading. I wandered around the world, and never stopped
reading. I ended up here, now, and still keep reading, but now I read more widely and variously than ever
before, because of the Web. I believe what my friend [Chris Shiflett
believes](http://shiflett.org/blog/2012/oct/lessons-from-brooklyn-beta), that ‘The Internet is the
opportunity of our generation.’ I believe that our work building the Web can contribute. I believe human
beings are fundamentally good. I’m not sure how that will manifest itself, but I believe that if we
remove the stress we may find out. I believe we can do it, and I always will.
