I recently was able to see Douglas Crockford speak. He had a fantastic premise: we are flawed beings
attempting to create perfect programs for machines. What struck me during the talk was how few developers
acknowledge this. We all make mistakes—we may have missed a keystroke because we were distracted by music we
were listening to, hunger, or the phone ringing. And yet we all too often relish pointing out flaws in other
people’s code, as if we could never be guilty of the same. Perhaps more humility and acceptance are in
order in our industry.
