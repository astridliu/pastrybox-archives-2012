The best thing about freelancing for me was having my commute be 10 steps down a hallway. The worst thing was
how often I never made the commute back from the office. Working from home is a great thing in many ways, but
it takes discipline. A trick I learned a few years back was to put shoes on while I was working and take them
off when I wasn’t. Simple mental hacks like that make all the difference. A bigger tip is to trade in
your laptop for a desktop. Don’t take your work out of the office.
