What if there was a way we could collect disparate pieces of information: blog posts, news articles, videos,
tweets, comments, etc. and collectively annotate them? We have blogs now, but the concept of annotation
hasn’t been widely realized. There has got to be a better, more visual, semantic way to display this
kind of information, reflection, and conversation. I’m most interested in how we document and collect
our thoughts publicly and collaboratively. Imagine the learning that could take place.
