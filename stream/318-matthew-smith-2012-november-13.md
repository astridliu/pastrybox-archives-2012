Are you taking time to design your family? This is the question I’ve been asking myself. 

I wake up some nights with an interface problem spinning in my brain – unable to figure out where to put the
series of actions for an unsolvable UX. It’s terrible, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, but it
dawned on me that I’m not waking up thinking about how to solve education for my sons. I’m never
white-boarding solutions to help my daughter feel dearly loved in the face of a culture that will objectify
her.

One of the most impactful things I can do in my life may be the least worthy of publicity or even
retweeting.
