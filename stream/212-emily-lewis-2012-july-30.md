I get writer’s block fairly often. In fact, as I’m writing this, I *have* writer’s block.
I’ve been thinking about this pastry box contribution for over a month and … nothing.

I’ve tried all the tips for overcoming writer’s block, from doing writing exercises to keeping
self-imposed deadlines. They don’t typically work for me. I’ve tried shifting focus to something
else, listening to music, reading, pretty much anything. Nope, that usually doesn’t work either.

To be honest, I don’t know what “works” other than time and, for me, playing the mental game
of figuring out the source of my block. And sometimes, when the deadline is looming, the only thing to do is
write something, *anything*, and move on. Thanks for reading my something ;)
