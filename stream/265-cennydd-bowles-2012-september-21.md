It’s taken me a while, but my RSS reader is starting to gather dust. I’ll admit it was a solution
to at best an edge case – ‘show me everything these people ever write’ – but I liked having a
mechanism that prioritised recall over precision.

But now I need filters; and my personal networks provide them. Networks encourage a kind of contextual
meritocracy: strong, relevant ideas tend to bubble to the surface. This is, of course, why even the most
technically-minded companies around are pursuing the social agenda. It’s heartening to know that humans
can still outperform the machines from time to time.
