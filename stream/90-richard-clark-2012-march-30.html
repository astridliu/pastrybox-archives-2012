       <p>Time. It's a precious commodity. Some would argue that time is, perhaps, the most precious commodity. Family, friends, work, hobbies, chores, side projects, education & more all warrant & need our time yet it's the one thing we can't have more of. Sure we can work smarter and use tools to improve our productivity but ultimately we can't have more time. I often find myself thinking about dormant domains, looking through sketchbooks and notepads full of great ideas.</p><p>How many great ideas for side (or other) projects never come to fruition because of alack of time? We need a place to share those ideas with like minded people. Blogs, Twitter, Github, Kickstarter & others help facilitate this but all are lacking in some way. I'd like to see a place where Ican give ideas away, some throwaway, some more thought through. Aplace where someone will take on those ideas if they deem them worthy and because they have the time. Maybe somewhere exists that I don't know about, or maybe this is just another idea I don't have time for.</p>
