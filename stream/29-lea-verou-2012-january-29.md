Often people ask me how I come up with the new ideas I publish. I think my main “differentiator” is that I
try not to be restricted by my knowledge about what’s possible and what is not. I first think about what I
want to make (for example “I want to do a rating widget with pure CSS”) and then I investigate how it
could be done. And I don’t give up easily. Sometimes it even takes months having the question in the back of
my head before I come up with a solution.

People push the boundaries of what's achievable with web technologies every day. Do you want to be one of
them, or do you want to be stuck repeating what's been done over and over again until you get sick of it?
Don't be afraid to try new things. If a voice inside you screams “That isn’t possible!”, ignore it. In
most cases, this voice is wrong.
