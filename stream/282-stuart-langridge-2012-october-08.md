The web moves really fast. How many times have you googled for a tutorial on or an example of something and
found that the results, written six months or a year or two years ago, no longer work? The syntax has changed,
or there’s a better way now, or it never worked right to begin with. You’ll hear people bemoaning
this: trying to stop the web moving so quickly in order that knowledge about it doesn’t go out of date.
But that ship’s sailed. This is the world we’ve built: it moves fast, and we have to just hat up
and deal with it. So, how? How can we make sure that old and wrong advice doesn’t get found? It’s
a difficult question, and I don’t think anyone’s seriously trying to answer it. We should try and
think of a way.
