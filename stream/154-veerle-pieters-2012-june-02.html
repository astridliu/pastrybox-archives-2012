       <p>I always find it hard to explain in a practical way how I choose and apply colors in a design. To me it has a lot to do with intuition; a feeling that certain colors go well together and others don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a very subjective matter, and who am I to say that, for example, a certain type of soft brown in combo with a flashy red doesn&#8217;t work well.</p><p>There isn&#8217;t a magical formula that explains how to choose the right colors. I&#8217;m not a believer in strict rules when it comes down to design, because there is always a lot of grey area in this matter. I think it&#8217;s mostly about seeing what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Tools like <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a>, or the colors in my <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/inspiration/">Inspiration Gallery</a> can help in seeing what works together and what doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s something that comes with trial & error. I never know upfront if the colors I have in my mind will work well together. I usually do the test by looking at it from a distance. I enlarge the design, making it as big as possible on my screen, and I step away to look at it from a distance of 3 meters. A lot of times I feel I need to change certain colors, because it didn&#8217;t seem to work very well in combination with the other colors. Sometimes it&#8217;s just lack of contrast, or it feels as if it&#8217;s out of sync with the others. It basically comes down to feeling what looks good, and what doesn&#8217;t. Studying how others apply color also helps in becoming better at it.</p>
