If your jobby job doesn’t have you producing work that’s meaningful to you, find somewhere to
volunteer your skills. The most fulfilling and fun work I’ve done‚ outside of my current job‚
wasn’t for money. It was for good causes. You can have a real impact on your community and the
non-profit, school, etc. you choose will be grateful and have more funds to use elsewhere.
