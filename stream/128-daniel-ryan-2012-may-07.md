When I'm working on a project for a client, it's rarely the wants of the client I focus on. Instead, it's the
needs of their clients. I can't even begin to count how many arguments I've had with my clients (or designers)
about type that's too small or colors that are too distracting or "make the logo bigger". The next time one of
your clients tells you "the customer is always right", ask him if he'd make that argument to a pilot or
surgeon.
