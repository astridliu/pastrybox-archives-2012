# Retreat. Advance. Ret-vance.

When I was initially asked to contribute to this project, I played with the idea of writing up all of my
thoughts in one fell swoop so I didn’t have to think about what to write every month. However, somewhere
around the mid-point of the year, I decided I would much rather have my thoughts be a true accounting of what
was going on with me at the point in time that I compose my thought instead.

So, here I am at the close of the year. Like many people, I take this time to look back at the last 12 months
to assess where I have been to get a better handle on where I want to go moving forward. This year has been
great in so many respects, but I feel I could have done so much more if I had been in a different mode. This
year, and for several years, I’ve been in what I like to think of as “ret-vance” mode.

What is being in ret-vance? It’s being in-between “retreat” and “advance”.

Advance mode is when you feel like everything is “on and poppin’ ” — everything you initiate seems to
work, situations fall into place, you meet exactly the right people at the right time. You get the job you
want, you get the big promotion, you meet the person of your dreams, you launch the new project…you get the
idea. You’re moving forward, pursuing what you want, and you have not only the drive, but also the energy
and resources for it all.

Retreat mode is when you’re pooped, burnt out, stressed, tired. When you can only half-heartedly make
efforts towards your goals if you can make any effort at all. When small motions seem like monumental effort.
Sometimes when all of that is happening, what you really need is to just give yourself permission to take a
break.

Ret-vance is somewhere between the two — a volley back and forth between bursts of moving forward and
pursuing with gusto, only to fairly quickly feel stymied by fatigue, lack of focus, and resultant
setbacks.

When looking at the past 3-4 years, I see that I have been caught more and more frequently in “ret-vance”
mode. I see it with all of the projects that I have initiated and not been fully able to launch; with the
ideas for blog posts, articles, and books I have planned to write and have not started on; updated websites
for myself, my portfolio and so many other things; collaborations that I haven’t been able to make tangible.
That which I have been able to accomplish, like contributing a chapter to Smashing Book #3, developing and
delivering new presentations, and completing several client projects has countered the aforementioned stymied
efforts. But I feel that I probably could have produced so, so much more.

Being in ret-vance is *frustrating* — especially when you don’t realize it’s happening.

The cure for ret-vance mode? I think it’s to choose. Make a choice: if you need to fully retreat, then fully
retreat. Give yourself permission to not do those projects, to not go after stuff, to rest — completely.
Maybe that’s why stuff isn’t clicking — because it isn’t supposed to and you need downtime to
rejuvenate yourself.

Or, maybe you need to choose to advance: to really go for whatever it is you are focused on. Maybe you’ve
been spreading yourself too thin and you need to take your hands out of a few pies to be able to just focus on
one or two things and give them your all.

So, my goal for next year is to get out of ret-vance and to advance (as I feel I have retreated long enough):
get rid of the areas in which I formerly believed I “should” be focusing my energy, but am no longer
interested in; release that which no longer fits with me; and to fully focus on the things that I love, am
passionate about and that excite me.

What mode will you choose for the next year?
