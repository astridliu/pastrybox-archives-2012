Last month, I was checking out the [#eecms Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=%23eecms) for
updates about ExpressionEngine, and I saw an update from [Amy Witty](https://twitter.com/amywitty) who was
trying EE for the first time:

And shortly after, she posted an update that made me remember [*my* first time with
EE](http://ablognotlimited.com/articles/not_a_big_fan_of_expressionengine_right_now):

> Aaaaaargh...

Learning EE is challenging. Learning *anything* new is challenging. It’s a frustrating process and it
can be hard to ask for help, especially as a newbie. Which was why it was so gratifying to see the EE
community show it’s true colors in response to Amy’s #eecms updates.

After her first “frustrated” tweet, several folks chimed in to offer
support:

> [September 8, 2012](https://twitter.com/QBmarketing/status/244258827023826945)

And it just continued from there. It’s *still* continuing as I write this. From issues with her initial
install to her ongoing development, the #eecms community has offered Amy support, resources and advice. And
Amy has her first EE site up and
running:

If you follow me on social networks, you know that ExpressionEngine is a major focus for me these days. The
reasons: 1) I’m co-host of [EE Podcast](http://ee-podcast.com), so I *have* to be focused on EE and 2)
it’s my CMS of choice now that I’m working for myself.

But this isn’t why I highlight this story. I share this story because it reminds me of the best of the
web industry.

I learned how to be the web professional I am from my colleagues; my community. Sure, I got the “piece
of paper” certifying for the uninformed human resources recruiter that I’m “qualified”
for my job. But what I do every single day is a result of people sharing information, and me taking the time
to test that information.

This cycle of sharing and learning is one of my favorite things about being a web professional. When I started
on the web, I learned by reading blog posts and tutorials. 13 years later, I’m *growing* by reading blog
posts and tutorials *and* Twitter *and* Facebook. We’re still sharing, and we’re still
learning.

I love the story of EE and Amy. It shows how a community can help an individual learn and grow. And it shows
how individuals of that community can be reminded of the importance of being an *active* part of an
community.
