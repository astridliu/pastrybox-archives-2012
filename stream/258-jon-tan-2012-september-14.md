The August sun was fierce, the water cold, and I was sitting under a tree cooling down next to the [Lac du
Salagou](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=lac+du+salagou,+france&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=65.17542,130.517578&hnear=Lac+du+Salagou&t=h&z=14).
My boys were throwing themselves around in the water on giant blow-up crocodiles, and my wife and
mother-in-law were quietly talking and sunbathing next to me. It was supremely peaceful. My mind wandered to
all the times I’ve been away and all the moments I wished my family were with me. [Fireworks in

I reminded myself how lucky I am, but I also reminded myself who I’m working for, and why. Sure, I work
for my own satisfaction as well as my family, but fundamentally they have to come first. As the industry we
work in accelerates, I try to keep learning, attending and talking at events, and working on what I love, but
I know I love my family more. Fireworks, ancient walks, and awesome views are a joy, but lessened by their
absence. So, later that day, I managed to get a data signal on my phone, and cancelled a few talks and trips I
had coming up. I put off some other things that would take me away from my family. I said no to work, and yes
to them, and by doing so, felt better about the work I will do, and what I’ll achieve by doing it, in
their name.
