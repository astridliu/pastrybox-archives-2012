Last year, I (re)discovered scan paths, or the route our eyes follow through interfaces. I’d come across
research in the area before, but hadn’t delved in too deep. An important moment was re-reading Dr. Kevin
Larson’s article on [The Science of Word
Recognition](http://microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx).

The roughly Z-shaped path our eyes take when navigating an interface fascinates me. It relates directly to
understanding text at the legibility or micro typography level, and composition at the readability, or macro
typography level. It aligns with a dual concept I’ve been thinking a lot about: I call it impact versus
immersion. Or display versus body. Or emotion versus comprehension.

The immediate, emotional, subconscious feeling we have about an interface when we first see it is powered by
the amygdala — one of the oldest parts of the brain also known as the lizard brain — which can receive
sensory input and generate an emotional response in us often without the words to describe what it is, or why
we feel the way we do.

The utility we find in interfaces creates an emotional response, too, but through function, and delight in
use. When the information is legible and readable, the interface’s character becomes invisibly useful. The
style fades into the background, and the utility comes to the fore.

It’s a little like perfect service in a restaurant. The expert waiting staff don’t impose, or interrupt
the great conversation we’re having with friends, or intimate moment with partners. Our glasses are
refilled, and the dishes arrive almost invisibly, gently, and fluently.

I think we’re often designing for both. Composing with scan paths in mind helps us do just that.
