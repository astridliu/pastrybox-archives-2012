Easy to forget during our busy days, writing for me has to be one of the most important things we as designers
do. Writing makes you pause to consider what you’ve done. It gives you time to understand problems and
organise your thoughts. It’s a way to practice your so important communication skills and your
capability to synthesise your ideas and express yourself.
