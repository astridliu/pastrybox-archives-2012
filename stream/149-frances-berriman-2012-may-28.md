My colleague and friend, [James Weiner](http://twitter.com/jamesweiner), brought to my attention this
fascinating read from IBM: [Designing for
Usability](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~vassilis/courses/pui09S/papers/gould-85.pdf). I think what's most
interesting about it is how sound the advice is some 30 years later, and also their conclusion that what may
seem like common sense is not always intuitive. I think it's worth challenging your own views and critiquing
whether you really do always follow your own best advice.
