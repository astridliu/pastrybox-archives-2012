       <p>When I decided to work for myself, a part of me envisioned all the extra free time I would have. Two years into it, I definitely don&#8217;t have more free time. I&#8217;m working harder than I ever have, and I&#8217;m involved in more projects than ever before.</p><p>I often work long hours. I don&#8217;t typically take a traditional weekend off. I sometimes even work holidays. It isn&#8217;t exactly what I expected. It&#8217;s actually better.</p><p>I&#8217;m more productive than I&#8217;ve ever been with work. I never responded well to a Monday–Friday, 9–5 week. So much of what I do is creative in nature, and sometimes I just can&#8217;t force it. Rather than sitting behind a desk, wasting hours feeling frustrated and stagnant, I now get chores done, read a book or go for a walk. And because I work from home, my office is there when the productivity bug strikes.</p><p>Not only can I work when I want, I work where I want. Sometimes it&#8217;s the local coffee shop. Sometimes it&#8217;s the hotel room when I&#8217;m at a conference. Sometimes it&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s house in Charlottesville or my best friend&#8217;s condo in Seattle. I have freedom to go where I want and still be responsible for my business.</p><p>My days feel more balanced. I wake when I want (or, rather, when the cats want to be fed). I have time to exercise and get outside before I even turn on the computer. I have weekly appointments that I don&#8217;t have to book months in advance, because I&#8217;m available the middle of the day. I bypass crowded grocery stores because I can hit Trader Joe&#8217;s when no one else is there.</p><p>No, working for myself, I don&#8217;t have more free time. I have more quality of time. </p>
