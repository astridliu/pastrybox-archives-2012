As this is my final thought of the year, I’d like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Alex and
Katy for providing me with the opportunity to write for The Pastry Box Project. From my experience with HTML5
Doctor and Gallery I’m fully aware of how difficult managing side projects is, particularly where others
are involved and there are deadlines to hit.

Sitting down and formalising my thoughts, ideas and feelings by writing them isn’t something I do often
so I’m grateful that being part of The Pastry Box has given me a platform to do just that. 

Looking back over the year, I now see real value in penning these observations in a way that I didn’t
before. It’s opened my eyes to the benefits of writing. I can’t say for sure that I’m going
to start writing and publishing regularly about topics other than HTML & CSS tutorials, but you never know.


I wish Alex, Katy and The Pastry Box Project the fondest of farewells and all the best for the coming years
along with the exciting things they have planned. I think they’ve hit on a really interesting format for
publishing and involved some of the best minds in the industry. It’s been a pleasure to be part of it.
I’ll be sure to follow their progress and so should you. Happy New Year.
