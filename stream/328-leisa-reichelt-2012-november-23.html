       <p>When I see someone advocating their way as the one right way, here&rsquo;s the framework I use for critique.</p><p>The first lens:</p><p>Does your one right way emphasises a skill that you are particularly strong in? Do I need to be clever and experienced in the same way that you are in order for your methodology to work for me? </p><p>It&rsquo;s very easy to advocate that everyone do things the way that you do, after all, it works for you, right?</p><p>Graphic designers are appalled by projects that aren&rsquo;t led by people with the appropriate level of &lsquo;taste&rsquo;, developers are appalled by designers who don&rsquo;t write CSS. Yet, all different approaches seem to work for different people. </p><p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got a method that works for you but if your particular talent and experience are a prerequisite for making it work, I&rsquo;m going to be cautious about recommending your approach to the rest of the world.</p><p>The second lens:</p><p>Does your one right way allow everyone in your team* to contribute to their full ability and feel as though they are a worthy and valued member of the team?</p><p>If you are the only person in the team who gets to do the really fun, interesting work and everyone else is busy documenting, or colouring in, or coding up your amazing work, you&rsquo;re advocating waste of the worst kind — waste of talent and passion.</p><p>If your methodology isn&rsquo;t multidisciplinary early on — early enough for people other than you to be <em>really</em> involved in making really interesting and important decisions, you&rsquo;re not getting the best from your team. (Also, no, a meeting to show them your wireframes and ask for feedback doesn&rsquo;t count).</p><p>The way we choose to work has a huge impact on the kind of work we turn out. Take some time to think about the alternatives, to be brave and (if you need to) fight for a better way.</p><p>* Sadly, not everyone has a team to work with. Working with a great team is the best way to get better at what you do, and lots of other things you didn&rsquo;t do before. Don&rsquo;t let yourself be team-less for too long.</p>
