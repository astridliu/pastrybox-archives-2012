The web is about the availability of information and sharing knowledge through connecting. A practice that we
always need to be exercising as web professionals is to reach for that which is just beyond our grasp: either
in terms of concepts, ideas, skills, techniques, and even connections with other people. It is that which we
haven’t reached yet—but desire to get to—that helps both ourselves and the industry expand, grow, and
mature.
