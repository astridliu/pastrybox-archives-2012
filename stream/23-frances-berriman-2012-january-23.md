One of the reasons I enjoy what I do for a living, is it feels as though we're in an industry where we're
still exploring and working out what we want. We get to define the technology, approach and ethos of what we
do in a raw sense, from language design, browser features, scalability or user experience. You name it!
Because we probably haven't yet. We should feel privileged to do what we do __while we still don't know
exactly what it is we're doing__.

We're not *just* building throw-away websites, we're building an entire way of working from the ground up, and
we all still get a say in what that looks like. It's pretty exciting, don't you think?
