Before you start complaining about what you don’t like in CSS, HTML or JavaScript, ask yourself: How
would I do it better? Sometimes, the things that bother us are just unavoidably subpar solutions to very hard
problems. It sounds obvious, but many people I’ve spoken with get a completely new perspective when they
ask themselves this question. Also, there are many other factors affecting design choices, beyond syntactical
elegance and ease of understanding. For example, making implementations easier, maintaining backwards
compatibility or matching what browsers already do. Sometimes that “obvious better solution” is
just not possible in practice.
