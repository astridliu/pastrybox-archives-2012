One day, the Web as we knew it will be entirely differentthan the words baked so lovingly in this book 

We hope it is still tasty, filled with nourishmentthat we left it better than when we were here

For the Web, much like a child, may throughout its life reflect the hearts, the hope, the desires of all
humanity poured out on its pixels

Dancing on a billion dreamslet the good shine for this is the timenow is the time

To remember that the Web is humanityand itâ€™s greatness is determined by each individual

Let usbreak of this bread,and peace be upon us all.
