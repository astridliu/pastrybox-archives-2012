Like any of the other bakers here on this site, I receive quite a few e-mails from people presenting their
work or project to me, hoping I will share it with my readers, or Twitter or Facebook etc. Some of them get
shared, others do not. My decision is of course based on whether I like it or not, and also if it’s
valuable. But even before I get to this point, some basic criteria has already been taken into account which
influences my judgement. There are a few basic guidelines that you can keep in mind to have the best chance
your message will be heard. Always write in a personal way, and make sure your message also sounds personal,
but keep it brief and to the point. So always address people by their name, not with a simple “Hi”
or “Hello there”, because to me this means the person doesn’t really know me, and the
message is part of some list that gets sent out. The follow-up of these kinds of e-mails will most likely be
unsuccessful. Make sure if the message links to photos or other kinds of images that they are big enough, so
that no extra communication is needed on where bigger images can be found. And most importantly don’t
forget the URL, and make sure it’s correct.
