The above text is from the Web Standards Project “Browser Upgrade Campaign” launched in early
2001. Web designers and developers were frustrated that people were not upgrading away from the buggy Netscape
4. To fix this problem, and encouraged by WaSP, designers started putting a message on their sites exhorting
people to upgrade or even redirecting them to a page blocking access to the site. A [search on Google for some

finds many of these upgrade pages still in existence.

As time has passed most of us have realised that locking people out of sites because we don’t like their
browser is not appropriate. However, ever since 2001, our frustrations repeat. [Internet Explorer
6](http://www.ie6countdown.com/) becomes the enemy. An online retailer runs a PR stunt announcing that they
would [apply a tax to anyone using their store with
IE7](http://www.netmagazine.com/news/retailer-announces-ie7-tax-122022) due to the cost of supporting these
older browsers. [37 Signals
announce](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3097-developing-for-old-browsers-is-almost-a-thing-of-the-past) that
people using Internet Explorer in the latest versions of their product will require IE9 or greater.

The better our browsers become the more this frustration looks like the whining of people who forget that not
everyone is on a shiny Mac, on a fast net connection with easy access to the latest browsers; who forget that
many regular folk do not even know what a browser *is*. If you are a professional web developer then __your
job__ is to deal with legacy browsers, operating systems and devices. That was the case in 2001 and it is
still the case now. The faster the pace of new additions to HTML and CSS, then the quicker perfectly capable
browsers look out of date due to their lack of support. However as anyone who developed for Netscape 4 will
tell you, lack of support is very different from buggy support. We have never had it so good.

Of course supporting and testing in older browsers adds time and effort to our projects. Doing a professional
job does take time, effort and thought. I will continue to be led by the real browser stats I check before
starting work on a project. The decision as to which browsers I support and the level of support I give them
is not an arbitrary one that I make, it is led by data, and is different from project to project.

If you believe that your job is to show off how clever you are with the latest technologies then you will
always be frustrated by older browsers. However the web I care about is the web that is for everyone, that
enables people to participate, learn and communicate with each other across many different divides. My job is
developing for that web, and sometimes that means I have to make technology choices that aren’t quite as
fun or interesting to me. That’s a shame, but ultimately I’m not developing these sites for me. By
keeping my user in mind I know that the work I do to give them an appropriate level of support is
worthwhile.
