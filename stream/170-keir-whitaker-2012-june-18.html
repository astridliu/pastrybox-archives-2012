       <p>I have worked for myself, either as a freelancer or as part of a <a href="http://viewportindustries.com">small company</a>, as is now the case, for 6 of the last 9 years. Many of us talk about the great advantages of &#8220;being your own boss&#8221;. How many times have you been in a conversation with someone who says something like &#8220;It&#8217;s alright for you, you can do what you want when you want!&#8221;</p><p>For the most part they are right, it&#8217;s great working from your favourite coffee shop or on a train whilst you are travelling in the middle of the day to see a friend. However I have to say it&#8217;s not without it&#8217;s problems.</p><p>One of my aims for 2012 was to try and improve the line between work and home, or work and &#8220;not work&#8221;. My commute is literally seconds so I have put things in place to help. For example every day I get out of the house to take my children to school. It&#8217;s a great start to the day, unless it&#8217;s raining, and an opportunity to get some time to think. Additionally I decided to take all public holidays as holidays (something I haven&#8217;t always done).</p><p>So what&#8217;s the point of me telling you all this? Well it struck me the other day that I really don&#8217;t know how to take a &#8220;day off&#8221;â€”remember those? A day to yourself, not a public holiday or a weekend, a day that you mark off in your calendar just for you. I had hoped to book in one or two a quarter but so far it hasn&#8217;t happened. The problem is that I love what I do. Work pays the bills, but the web and design fascinate me. Taking a &#8220;day off&#8221; would likely turn into me checking emails in a coffee shop, reading a blog post or worse, fixing a bug.</p><p>I&#8217;ve decided that the next day off will be completely un web related. There&#8217;s plenty left to discover in and around the area I now live in. Museums, steam railways, great restaurants, river rides and independent cinemas to name but a few.</p><p>The funny thing is when you do make the time and do something different you normally come away with a new perspective, an idea for a design influcenced by a coffee shop menu, the solution to that problem that has been annoying you for days. Deep down we know all this but do little about it, I speak from experience. Let&#8217;s try it, after all that email will still be there when you get back!</p>
