       <h1>Once-a-week email </h1><p>About two years ago I started a little experiment with my personal inbox that has been working surprisingly well.</p><p>I have a personal inbox, through which I handle all my freelance work, writing gigs, family and friends, banking communications, etc., and a separate company inbox, which is provided by my employer.</p><p>For a few weeks, I decided to try to only reply to email from new contacts in my personal inbox once a week: Sunday evenings, when things are quiet, and people don&rsquo;t reply back as quickly as mid-week. These emails include prospective design and writing gigs, recruitment agencies, admin stuff like bills, requests for help or interviews, and other non-urgent requests. They do <em>not</em> include current clients, (genuinely) urgent requests and my family.</p><p>I use Gmail for my private account. When I get an email, I star it and archive it. As much as I can, I try not to read the details, or I know I&rsquo;ll be thinking about it all the time, which will distract me until it&rsquo;s actually time to focus on a response. On Sunday evenings, I&rsquo;ll sit down and reply to all emails at once. Some weeks this takes longer than others, but most weeks, because I&rsquo;m completely focused on this task, it can take between 15 to 45 minutes (unless there&rsquo;s a particularly lengthy email that needs a lot of planning and thinking).</p><p>This has been working really well, and since I decided to give this a try I&rsquo;ve never looked back. Not only does it save me time because I don&rsquo;t get distracted from my work throughout the week, but it also makes sure that everyone that sent me a genuine contact request gets a reply within a reasonable timescale.</p>
