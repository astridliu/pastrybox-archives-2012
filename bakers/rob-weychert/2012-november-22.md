This is a continuation of some thoughts from last month about [inefficiency by
design](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/rob-weychert/2012-october-19/).

I have an information retention problem. I absorb a lot of it, all of which is presumably stored somewhere,
but not nearly as much of it remains available for unassisted recall as I would like. Not surprisingly, the
stuff that is best remembered has been reinforced, usually through some kind of repeated application or
extensive immersion. In other words, if something is retained in my long-term memory, I probably had to work
for it. Fair enough. Accordingly, my long-term memory is full of stuff that has been experienced with
regularity, has spoken directly to my natural curiosity, and/or has given me a meaningful challenge that
I’ve managed to meet.

Many of those meaningful challenges have come from various forms of art, and a recent visit to a [Quay
Brothers exhibition](http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1240) at the Museum of Modern Art offered
a good reminder of why that is. One of my favorite films from the Quays is a short documentary called
[Anamorphosis (or De Artificiali Perspective)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D80A04qmO0). It explores the
artistic application of [anamorphosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis), a technique for producing
distorted imagery that can only be comprehended by viewing it from a particular angle. While this technique
could easily be dismissed as a gimmick, the Quay Brothers make a point of discussing its
value:

> Anamorphosis is a most powerful device for controlling understanding. It may
> be used whimsically to amuse, or else it can provoke and instruct. An image grasped too quickly might not
> leave a lasting impression. To lead the eye slowly through incomprehension and then to offer a resolution –
> *that* is insight.

My interest in design grew out of my interest in art, and I’ve spent my share of time pondering the
distinctions between the two. Most would agree that an artistic technique like anamorphosis, which intends to
(at least initially) obfuscate information, has no place in any form of communication design, which intends to
make information as clear and easily accessible as possible. And that seems like a reasonable boundary: the
amount of work required of the audience for comprehension is determined by the content creator, and the
designer’s job is to find the best way to present that content appropriately for the audience. Indeed, the
mantra designers project on the audience is, “[Don’t make me
think.](http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html)”

But should design always be an invisible liaison between content creator and audience? Can its focus on ease
of use do a disservice to an audience who would benefit from a challenge? If we retain information better when
we work for it, are there occasions when design should obstruct rather than elucidate?
