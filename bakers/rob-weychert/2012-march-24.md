Personal statistics fascinate me, and in the information age, I’m collecting a ton of them.
[Last.fm](http://last.fm/) keeps track of what music I listen to and when I listen to it.
[Letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com/) does the same for movies, and the tagging system I’m using within it
tells me how the movies were formatted, where I watched them, and more. [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/) and
[Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) keep tabs on my reading, [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/) and
[Tripit](http://tripit.com/) chronicle the details of my travels, and DICE’s
[Battlefield](http://battlefield.com) series knows exactly how many bullets I’ve fired in virtual combat,
which weapons they came from, how good my aim is, and much, much more.

A smart person might be able to put together a decent psychological profile with this stuff. But if the
subject has access to his own data in real time, is that profile reliable? I pore over my personal statistics
somewhat religiously, and in many cases, it affects my behavior. I’ll be careful to space out an album’s
repeat listens, even if it’s something I adore. I’ll go out of my way to rotate my reading between fiction
and non-fiction. Ostensibly, I do this to make my experiences more well-rounded, or at least to give the
appearance of well-roundedness to whomever might be looking.

But am I really doing myself any favors by paying attention to the play-by-play? Does such a calculated
approach to these experiences rob them of their potential for serendipity? Does it needlessly impede the whims
of natural curiosity?
