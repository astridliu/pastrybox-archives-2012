We notice the sort of design that demands to be noticed, and make the mistake of proclaiming it to be some
kind of “game changer”, glossing over its functional failings in favor of its unique approach to a
problem. But the truth is that the game is much more likely to be changed incrementally, by design that
doesn’t call attention to itself. When we wake up tomorrow, we won’t be greeted by a new and grand
spectacle of human ingenuity. Instead, we’ll fit another tiny, seemingly mundane piece into a puzzle that
will never be completed. The people who move things forward are the ones who can see spectacle in slow
motion.
