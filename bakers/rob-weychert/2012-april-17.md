In an article for Smithsonian magazine, renowned magician Teller (of the duo Penn & Teller) offers [a handful
of guiding principles for altering an audienceâ€™s
perceptions.](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Teller-Reveals-His-Secrets.html) This one is my
favorite:

> Make the secret a lot more trouble than the trick seems worth. You will be
> fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be
> willing to invest.

This is the stuff great design is made of: lavishing a totally unreasonable amount of attention on even the
most seemingly insignificant details.
