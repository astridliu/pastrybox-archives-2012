The mobile pundits got it right: sites should be minimal, functional, with everything designed to help the
user complete a task, and then go. But that doesn't mean that you need to make a separate mobile site from
your normal site. If your normal site isn't minimal, functional, with everything designed to help the user
complete a task, it's time to rethink your whole site.

And once you've done that, serve it to everyone, whatever the device.
