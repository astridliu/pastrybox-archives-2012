My kids are sometimes confused when using the Web to do their homework, as sometimes (often!) two sites will
disagree or have conflicting “facts”. It’s a good lesson for them that what we used to call
the Information Superhighway is really a communication superhighway.

It’s good for us to remember that, too, as we finesse our design or finesse our APIs: all the design,
all the tech is merely a vehicle for communication. That’s what we’re building.
