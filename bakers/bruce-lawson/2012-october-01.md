Web site performance is in the news. There are [conferences](http://velocityconf.com/), 
[guidelines](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html), even a [W3C Working
Group](http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/). These are valuable, but we need to keep a sense of proportion. Of
course, reduce the number of HTTP requests your site makes and crush your images, but work out where the
biggest bang for your buck is likely to come from.

I’m on the Web 10 hours a day, 5 or 6 days a week, and the problems I have with web sites are seldom
attributable to a developer failing to minify a stylesheet or neglecting to shave a few vimtoseconds off a
JavaScript loop — they’re to do with lack of accessibility, bad information architecture, or usability
catastrophes like requiring me to sign up for endless spam before I can give my credit card details to buy the
product.

In situations where networks are really slow, or devices under-powered, spending time testing sites across
mobile browsers, and focussing on the user’s needs rather than bloating sites with organisational vanity
publishing should be your priority.
