I was at dinner with some fellow nerds the other night, and someone brought up the idea of coming across
something on the interwebs that was
[“tl;dr”](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr). As a lover of acronyms and an
owner of an occasional short attention span, I can totally relate. 

This way we choose what we deem worthy of our time to read and watch has also extended to our interfaces.
Think about the plethora of [one page sites](http://onepagelove.com/) out there. TMPTL? Too many pages to
load? Perhaps the more clicks we save our users, the more we show we respect their time. I’m not sure if
it’s an all or nothing pattern, but I do know I’d prefer an inline slideshow to a lightbox popup
most days.

Coda follows this pattern nicely with their product video on the [home page](http://panic.com/coda/) for the
release of Coda 2. Their [headline states](http://www.flickr.com/photos/radtacular/8248638824/)
“What’s new in two minutes. See the Coda Tour.” I love this because they let me know how
long this video is and because this video is short, I’ll totes watch it. The other bonus of their
implementation is that the video plays right inline with the page. They thought about the time of the
audience. No clicks, no lightbox, no new window, just instant gratification. And isn’t instant
gratification one of the things that makes the internet so great?
