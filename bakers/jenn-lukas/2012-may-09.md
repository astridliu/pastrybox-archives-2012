Here's a conversation that occurred on a train:

"How do you decompress from work?"

"I don't."

Reading through Twitter, blog posts and various other Internet correspondence, I've noticed a common theme.
Call it what you prefer: "venting", "complaining", and/or "reality", but a lot of us seem to be tired,
overworked, and/or stressed out. 

At the same time, wellness seems to be a theme gaining popularity. This is probably not a coincidence. We are
encouraged to balance our work and our personal life as to not get burned out on either. We see articles about
how [sitting is killing us](http://www.howtogeek.com/93822/sitting-is-killing-you-infographic/) and
contemplate purchasing [monitors that can tell us we have bad
posture](http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/09/tech/innovation/philips-monitor-better-posture/index.html).

But how exactly do we do that? It's been nice to see some solutions to these issues, such as  [ dimming our
screen every hour](http://breaktimeapp.com/), reminding us to get up and walk around. Or booking a [ private
villa in Spain](http://twitter.com/#!/simpleasmilk/status/187964612212301825) for when your team needs to work
overtime. Not so shabby ideas. I hope to see these more of these coming.
