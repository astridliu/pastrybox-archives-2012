The best career move I've ever made, and one of the best decisions of my life overall, was when I stopped
designing. I'd never heard of a "frontend developer" (I don't think the term was around yet) but that's what I
decided to focus on. Why? I'm a bad, seriously horrible, designer. In the six years since I made that decision
I've come to the conclusion that frontend and design come from opposite sides of the brain. You might be able
to technically do both, but you won't be great at both.
