I can only assume that when Sir Berners-Lee coined the term World Wide Web, he was envisioning the seeming
randomness of a spider's spinning that connects into a thing of beauty. But the metaphor is a double-edged
sword. This work of millions of people, easily the most amazing undertaking of our species, has ensnared us
all, directly or indirectly. And I'm OK with that.
