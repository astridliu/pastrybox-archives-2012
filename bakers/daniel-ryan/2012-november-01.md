Never do something more than twice that you can automate. Our jobs necessarily involve a lot of repetitive
actions and tedium, but don’t put up with any that you don’t have to. One of my favorites is a
little Python script I wrote called “makeproj”. It sets up a new folder structure for a project,
creates skeleton CSS and JavaScript files, makes a new project on Github and pushes the project there. Every
time I run it I save myself at least 15-30 minutes.
