If not now, then likely at some point in your career, you’ll be in a position to hire people. When you
do, try to hire people who are smarter than you. If you don’t find anybody that is, then look for people
who are eager to learn. There’s nothing worse than working for someone who needs to be the only one that
can actually get the job done except for working with people who think they’ve learned everything there
is to learn.
