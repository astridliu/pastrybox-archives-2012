For the past few years, my office has consisted of a laptop, a cat, and not a few cups of coffee. As a
dyed-in-the-wool hermit, this works remarkably well for me: I can use IM, Twitter, my phone, and text messages
to bring other people into my tiny little room of a world, and I’m continually thankful (and not a little
amazed) at how virtual I’m allowed to be in my work.

At the moment, however, I’m sitting in a studio looking out over a beautiful river, visiting another city
for some meetings. I’m reminded that there’s no substitute for working side-by-side with talented people,
turning your work around to get a quick reaction. At the end of the day, I’ll always yearn for that quiet,
tiny little office, but sometimes breaking out of your routine—even if only a little—can be pretty
powerful.
