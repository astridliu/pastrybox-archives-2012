I’ve got a pretty simple ritual when I sign up for a new service, or install a new application:

 *   If it’s a web service:

 *   Check to see if it sends me any email.

 *   If it does, disable it.

 *   If it’s a new application:

 *  Check to see if it publishes any activity alerts.

 *   If it does, disable them.

Others have written about this [more eloquently than I](http://adactio.com/journal/5721/), but I wish more
companies defaulted to a level of respect for a user’s inbox—and, by extension, their time. If it’s
something I find genuinely valuable, I’ll find a way to turn on that notification. Trust me.

But until we reach some sort of understanding, I’d love to keep a few glaring red badges off my phone’s
desktop, and a few more emails out of my inbox.
