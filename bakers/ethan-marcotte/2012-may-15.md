I’ve [written about this before](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/oversewing/), but I pace like crazy
when I’m on the phone. I don’t know what it is, but I think my body has to wander a bit so that my mind
doesn’t. So to stay focused, I walk little loops around the living room; I trace figure eights around my
kitchen; I walk up and down the front hallway.

This is, I’ve realized, kind of the inverse of what I do most of the day: sitting mostly immobile, staring
at glowing glass panes of various shapes and sizes, my mind racing up and down and through Photoshop, CSS
issues, todo items, and inboxes, running without moving until the evening, when rest comes.

Walking while thinking; mind racing while sitting. I need a middle ground: more walks without phones, more
focus in front of my computer.
