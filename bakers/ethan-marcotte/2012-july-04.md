“Mobile broke everything,” is how the saying goes. Of course, the *old* saying was “the web broke
everything.” Before that, I’m sure someone was grousing about internal combustion engines, steam power,
and/or the wheel.

Nothing ever really breaks, of course.

I mean, really: the web’s still *here*. But maybe we broke. Or at least, we’re left to rediscover a new
way to work. Or maybe an older, better way we’d forgotten. Because, really, I think that’s what mobile
truly broke: we’re realizing megabyte-heavy pages don’t cut it on poor connections; busy pages make for
poor experiences on smaller screens; progressive enhancement can help us design across an impressively broad
spectrum of devices. We’re rediscovering focus. How to do more with a little bit less. Faster frameworks,
leaner pages, less cruft.

Which, when you think about it, doesn’t sound broken at all. Quite the opposite, in fact.
