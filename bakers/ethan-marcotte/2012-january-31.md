It only took a decade or so of my colleagues telling me to do so, but Iâ€™ve finally gotten into the habit of
keeping a sketchbook with me at all times. I drew all the damned time as a boy, but as an adult I think I got
a little intimidated by pencil and paper. But being able to quickly sketch out an layout or scribble down an
idea is so, well, liberating.
