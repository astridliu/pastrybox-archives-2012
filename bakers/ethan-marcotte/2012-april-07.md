Focus is a fleeting thing, and I wonder if I’ve already let mine slip away. In the time it took me to write
that first sentence, I switched over to my browser to research something, and then popped over to Twitter,
then fired up my RSS feeds. It’s possible I never had much of an attention span to begin with, but
lately—more than I used to, certainly—I find myself missing life before wifi, before broadband, before
browser tabs.

And then I wonder: is this a design problem? I find myself spending more and more time working through my
reading backlog via apps like [Readability](http://readability.com/) and [Readmill](http://readmill.com/),
and I dream of a web that rewards focus—one that lengthens my attention span, rather than simply competing
for it.

Maybe it’s just me. But I do wonder if, instead of focusing on those three second rules, can we design
something, y’know, *slower*?
