The French have a phrase for it. "Reculer pour mieux sauter": to step backward for a better run-up.

Once you've clambered up the learning curve, the easy terrain of the plateau is a blessed relief. But look
closely and you may see another summit in the distance. If you want to reach it, you'll have to climb down
first.

Sometimes the best option is to throw away what's made you successful. Your next ascent may be more punishing
and even risky, but that adrenaline hit is intoxicating.
