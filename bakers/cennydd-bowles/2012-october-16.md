If technology doesn’t go the way we want it to (conjure up any techno-dystopia you like) history will
blame us. Instead of making technology easy, accessible, and pervasive, why didn’t we sabotage it at
every turn? If only we’d destroyed the data stores! Smashed the search engines!

If the future historians are generous, they’ll put our mistakes down to mere naiveté. Or perhaps
they’ll deem us traitors who collaborated with the enemy, our work an indictment of what happens when
egos trump ethics.

If technology goes the way we want it to, the vast majority of people won’t ever understand what we did.
As it should be.
