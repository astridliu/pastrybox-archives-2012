< Service Design.

Seems to me that a lot of the drama over job titles stems from a classic outflanking strategy: wanting to
appear more strategic than the other guy. We jostle for ascendency in this supposed value chain, trying to
appeal to more senior sensibilities in the hope of winning broader, richer projects. In the meantime, our
language becomes ever more grandiose, our deliverables more abstract, and our expertise even harder to
define.

Eventually we'll run out of abstractions, and this euphemism treadmill will creak to a halt. The only thing
left then will be to judge designers by our work; by the things we bring into the world. Hallelujah.
