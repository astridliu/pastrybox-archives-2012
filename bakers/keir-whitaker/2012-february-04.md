Having been knee deep in CSS for a number of years I had become set in my ways. Like many other people I much
prefered to hand code and generally avoided "frameworks". Looking back I am hard pushed to work out why, as I
say I was set in my ways.

Towards the tail end of 2011 I was chatting with my good friend [Greg](http://twitter.com/greg_a) and he asked
if I had tried out [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). I mentioned I had heard about it but hadn't really tried it
in anger. After a quick demo I was a convert.

Whilst I don't use the nesting capabilities that much variables, mixins and selector inheritance make creating
CSS quicker and more maintanable. If you write more than a few lines of CSS a day then I encourage you to give
it a try.

Couple this with a utility like [CodeKit for Mac](http://incident57.com/codekit/) and you won't even need to
open up Terminal and start installing Ruby and Gems. Next on my learning list, spurred on by [Mr.
Bodien](https://twitter.com/#!/bbodien), is [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
