Plugins are one of the main reasons I enjoy using WordPress. Here are four I end up using in nearly all
WordPress related projects. I hope you find them useful.

 *  [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/) - Simply activating this plugin will
increase the load times of your site, especially on shared hosting environments.

 *  [Maintenance Mode](http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/maintenance-mode/) - A great utility plugin that
allows you to activate a branded "maintenance" page, ideal for when you are deploying big changes or updating
your data.

 *  [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) - A recent addition to my standard library.
This plugin allows you to add groups of meta boxes to your posts, pages and custom post types. Field types
include date pickers, text, HTML editor and many more. Spend $25AUD on the ["repeater
field"](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/), you won't regret it.

 *  [Custom Post Template](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-post-template/) - This plugin allows you
to selectively choose templates for any individual post. For example, you can assign an entirely different
template to posts in a particular category. Your chosen template will replace single.php for the specified
post.
