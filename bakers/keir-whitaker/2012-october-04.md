Working in the web industry we often read about million dollar investments in the latest and greatest startup.


Startups come in all shapes and sizes. We are accustomed to reading about the latest hot startup securing a
huge sum of cash for their latest idea.

If you read one book on startups may I recommend that you part with a few pounds and grab a copy of [The $100
Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-100-Startup-Fire-Better/dp/023076651X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349036866&sr=8-1)
by Chris Guillebeau. 

Whilst not focusing exclusively on the web/tech industries it’s full of inspirational stories of people
earning a living running their own, often solo, businesses. None of them are making millions but all are
paying their bills, enjoying their work and are in control of their own destinies. It’s my non-fiction
book of the year so far.
