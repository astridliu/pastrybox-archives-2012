I would like to draw attention to a concept [Antony](http://zeroedandnoughted.com/) and I introduced in our
book [Fragile CSS](http://procssforhightrafficwebsites.com/). With the ubiquity of CSS3 and increasingly
complex and precise selectors, it is important to understand that, by using these sometimes too feeble rules,
you might be adding a level of fragility to your code that will bring you trouble along the line. Think: Is
your content likely to change? Are you making it hard to override this rule in the future? Do you need
something more flexible, that you can reuse?
