For a while I’ve been thinking conferences should start introducing shorter talks, so I was quite
pleased when Christian Heilmann posted his most recent article [“A Call For Shorter
Talks”](http://christianheilmann.com/2012/06/18/a-call-for-shorter-talks/). Christian lists all the
reasons I think less is more, including the audience’s short attention span and the need for the speaker
to focus his or her talk into a more consise topic. Being someone who is often sitting amongst the audience
and some times speaking, I would certainly welcome more 20-minute talks to the detriment of the common 1-hour
ones.
