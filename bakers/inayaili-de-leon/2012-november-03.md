A few years ago I read an article about those people you see in the street, walking about, shopping, having a
coffee, in the middle of a weekday, when everyone else is at work. It caught my eye because I always wondered
what those people were up to: are they millionaires that don’t have to work, are they just on holiday,
what’s up with them?

I’m not going to tell you what they were up to, but it’s not mind blowing (as one might expect).
Sadly I lost the link to the article. It’s somewhere on the Internet, but I can’t seem to find it
anymore. So, if anyone knows what I’m talking about, I’d be delighted to find that article
again.
