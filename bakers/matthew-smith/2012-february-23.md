We need a raising of the maturity bar in little web industry. I'd like to see more people asking questions of
each other and learning from each other. I don't care if you've been using designing for 10years or 10 days,
everyone still has something to learn â€“ and often from the most unlikely places. 

I'd like to see more people encouraging each other and spurring one another on. I'd like to see less back
patting and more challenging articulate critique executed with a healthy measure of grace.
