What is a designer? Is everyone at Dribbble a designer? Is there a distinction that needs to be made between
someone who can massage pixels into place to create a stunning 300x400 view of illustration or interface and
the individual who knows how to order chaos and solve problems visually, like an entrepreneur, and with care
for human realities like budgets and timelines?

I think there is. I think the former is a stylist and the latter is a designer. Creating or copying styles is
an art of itself and the talent shown at a place like Dribbble in this area is stunning, but true designers
are few and far between. It's an incredibly difficult thing to aspire to, and I'm hoping that I'm on that
path.
