       <p>The August sun was fierce, the water cold, and I was sitting under a tree cooling down next to the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=lac+du+salagou,+france&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=65.17542,130.517578&amp;hnear=Lac+du+Salagou&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">Lac du Salagou</a>. My boys were throwing themselves around in the water on giant blow-up crocodiles, and my wife and mother-in-law were quietly talking and sunbathing next to me. It was supremely peaceful. My mind wandered to all the times I&#8217;ve been away and all the moments I wished my family were with me. <a href="http://www.internationaldesfeuxloto-quebec.com/en/">Fireworks in Montreal</a>. Walking between <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jontangerine/7388848442/in/photostream">1300 year old trees</a> in Vancouver. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jontangerine/7385496624/in/photostream">view from the Space Needle</a> in Seattle.</p><p>I reminded myself how lucky I am, but I also reminded myself who I&#8217;m working for, and why. Sure, I work for my own satisfaction as well as my family, but fundamentally they have to come first. As the industry we work in accelerates, I try to keep learning, attending and talking at events, and working on what I love, but I know I love my family more. Fireworks, ancient walks, and awesome views are a joy, but lessened by their absence. So, later that day, I managed to get a data signal on my phone, and cancelled a few talks and trips I had coming up. I put off some other things that would take me away from my family. I said no to work, and yes to them, and by doing so, felt better about the work I will do, and what I&#8217;ll achieve by doing it, in their name.</p>
