If I had to hire someone based on one trait, it’d be curiosity. Curious people ask the
“How…” “Why?” and (most importantly!) “Why not…?” questions. This
desire to learn and make sense of the world is what leads someone to see what others haven’t— whether
it’s seeing the unseen things that are broken or new opportunities yet to be shown. Sure, once a subject
is understood, these individuals get bored easily and move on to the Next Big Thing. But while they’re
learning, they are the passionate student that every teacher desires, devouring every bit of information and
giving themselves over to this new endeavor. Add to this the wealth of experiences the curious mind has
accumulated, and you have a candidate who stands out from the rest.
