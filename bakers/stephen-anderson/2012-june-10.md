 Dear [Insert name] 

    Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this meeting.

    As someone who is paid to create value for this organization, I feel it is my ethical obligation to
decline participating in meetings that have neither (a) a stated purpose, nor (b) a clear agenda, as it is
well documented and agreed upon by most leadership teams that the absence of this intentional thinking costs
companies upwards of billions of dollars every year [insert link to most recent source]. If you wish for me to
attend, please send a second invitation with this information clearly stated so I can accurately estimate the
value of my attendance.

   Sincerely,

   [Insert name]
