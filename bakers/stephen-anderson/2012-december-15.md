A few years ago, I started adding a rather odd section to my proposals. In addition to the usual stuff (who I
am, their problem, what I’m proposing, pricing, and so on), I added a section entitled:

“Questions I’m Curious to Explore (Why this is personally exciting!)”

I did this for two reasons:

One, it doesn’t hurt to demonstrate that your interest in working with them is about more than the
money. Letting potential clients know that you’re really excited about the problem space, and why, is a
great way to set yourself apart from other proposals they may be entertaining.

Two, this was a good filter for me, personally. Answering the question “why do I want this
project?” forces you to look beyond financial compensation. I’m keenly aware of how the projects I
choose to invest my time in, in turn either advance, hinder, or alter my own learning trajectory. I’d
like to be intentional about the work I choose — not just for what it is, but how it affects me:
Emotionally. Financially. Timewise. What will I learn and who will I meet? What will I bring into the world?
How will this affect people? And how does this play into my personal narrative? Put into perspective, a six
month project is a good chunk of my life. I want to live my life with intention. I’ve turned down work
— good work — because it didn’t pass the “Questions I’m Curious to Explore”
test.

For the projects I do work on, once I’m a few weeks or months deep, it’s a nice reminder —
especially when things are tense — of what I (personally) hoped to get out of this investment of my time. I
can re-evaluate: Is what I wrote down still important? Are we on track? Am I learning new things that I
didn’t anticipate? 

Of course, being able to complete a “Questions I’m Curious to Explore” section means
there’s already a bank of things you want to learn more about, whether it’s new skills, something
you’d like to test, or something else. 

One theme that’s emerged for me over the last year is just how import learning, discovery, play —
being curious — is for me. This is a theme I’ve seen show up again in again each post I wrote and each
presentation I gave. I value curiosity, a lot. Not just for me, but for everyone. As a species, we are born
curious. We are hardwired to grow and discover the world around us. 

So I’d like to ask you a question:

“What are you curious about? What do you want to know more about by this time next year?”

Whether it’s related to your work, or some personal interest, write down something (or a bunch of
somethings!) you’re curious about. And then, pursue that topic to the point of exhaustion. Make
something based on what you’re learning. Share what you’re learning with others. Engage in
conversations about what you’re learning. You’ll discover a quiet kind of satisfaction that comes
from a challenge faced, and mastered. 

What are you curious about?
