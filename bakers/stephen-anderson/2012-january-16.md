I love the idea of turning work into playâ€”or even a game. But, as a former educator, I've been troubled by
something: Should we be making meaningful games out of ordinary problems, or should we teach kids how to "see"
ordinary problems as fun challenges? If we succeed at the latter, we all benefit from a game that never gets
old.
