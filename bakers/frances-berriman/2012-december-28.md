After a year of reading small gems of opinion from the bakers, the main point that sticks for me is how much
of the advice on here is timeless. It’s good to feel that we’re in a phase where we’re
collectively able to look beyond our current limits and products and start to see the long term story.

Technologies and capabilities will change, the devices we build for are as of yet unimagined, but the desire
and need to make products and services for people that make their lives easier, better or more fun will always
stick around and should be at the heart of what we’re doing as makers.
