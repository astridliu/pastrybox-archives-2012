Writing on the trip home from [TXJS](http://2012.texasjavascript.com)today, I realise I just gave my first
talk in over 18 months and that for the first time I wasn’t scared. I wonder what’s changed?
I’d been putting off doing any more speaking mostly through a lack of confidence and a few sub-par
panels at SxSW I’d participated in.

Recent conversations with friend, and fellow baker, Rachel Andrew inspired me with her tales of being afraid
of speaking, and flying, and just telling herself to not be anymore. Her blog post [Public Speaking for the
(Formerly)
Terrified](http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2012/05/02/public-speaking-for-the-formerly-terrified/) is a
sure read for anyone who has been put off speaking in the past.

The experience this last week was a blast, and I suppose I just want to encourage anyone who has thought of
speaking, or tried it and found it uncomfortable, that maybe you should give it another go. I might not have
been brilliant, but it turns out that it can actually be enjoyable to share a story about something you care
about, which is ultimately the point of getting up on stage in the first place.
