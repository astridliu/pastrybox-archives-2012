Today, I’m taking my nephew to the zoo. We’re going to feed the soulful, friendly giraffes and
there are some young lion pups too. My favorite creatures are the anteaters and the huge tortoises. Then
we’ll go sit in the aviary and listen to the shrieks of the beautiful, diverse birds in all their
colorful glory.

What does this have to do with doing great design work? Getting off the computer and into the
world—interacting with the happiness of achild among animals, sounds, smells and rich environments are all
part of refreshing ourselves as well as inspiring us through the sensory joy of simply being.

So do yourself a favor this week. Get offline and go do something that’s colorful, smelly, silly and
joyous!
