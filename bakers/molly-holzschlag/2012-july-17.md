We talk a lot about work-life balance, but I wonder how many of us truly achieve it? I’ve been doing a
lot of soul-searching lately, desperate to figure out how I have over-extended myself work-wise to the point
that I’m constantly disappointing editors by being late, not getting tasks done on time, and basically
just losing my once-powerful grip over the thing I always did well: Work. 

Is it aging that has made me this way? Discouragement with the dramas of our industry—the technology wars,
the fragmentation of aonce-clear vision of what The Web was meant to and could become—could these things be
in my way? Or is it that I just haven’t stopped to give myself a chance to have a life and life is
calling to me now—but I have yet to reconcile the relationship and remain stuck, or moving toward that
desired balance at a snail's pace? 

Here’s some advice from the heart: There is nothing wrong with giving your life to an ideal. I have done
it, and the rewards are rich— friends from all over the world, respect from my peers, to have traveled much
of the earth and been made welcome upon it—that is the miraculous part of giving your work your all, it
comes back. Just don’t let what happened to me happen to you—the work, the ideal takes over too young
and for too long, and you could easily end up childless or without family, with little or no life structure or
real measure of how to reconcile this elusive balance.

I know eventually I will reconcile what work/life balance really means for me. This pastry has been baked with
love for you—work hard, do beautiful and important work, and make a rich life for yourself in all ways—for
that will sustain you through your entire life.
