As designers & developers I'd say that we're pretty much always sold on concepts such as progressive
enhancement, responsive web design, designing in the browser, etc. We want to actively incorporate these
processes into our work as much as we can. Problems can arise though, for those of us who work in agencies.
Want to build that next site responsively? Someone has to pay.

In my role, I'm lucky that I get to meet clients early on and explain these concepts to them and explain the
benefits. Others I know that work in larger agencies or big organizations aren't so lucky. They're hampered by
archaic processes or sales people who refuse to alter their stock script. If this sounds like you, become an
educator, sit down and show them these new techniques and highlight the benefits. Generally people are
responsive to new ideas and ultimately you're the expert. If they choose not to listen, do yourself a favor
and go find some smart people to work for.
