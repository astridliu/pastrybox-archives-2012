       <p>I’m one day away from the very last of my speaking engagements for the year. I <em>love</em> speaking — I’m passionate about it and adore sharing my knowledge with an interested audience. So, when I am on the verge of a moment of wallowing in the fatigue that comes from sleeping in foreign beds, handling a bunch of different currencies, switching between languages, working to perfect my talks in limited time frames, and breathing the canned air of airplanes, I stop and look back at where I was 4 years ago.</p><p>Four years ago in 2008, I was working at a local company doing my least favorite work in the world: Project Management. The office was small, and the “cool kids” social circle even smaller. The AC was always at a temperature far lower than was comfortable for me, so I took frequent breaks to warm myself in the sun outside. My projects were big and unwieldy, and I got to exercise practically none of my natural visual and writing creativity. In short, I was miserable. I consoled myself with dreams of writing a book and becoming a speaker who travels to conferences all around the world presenting on subjects that were my passion.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2009 at SXSW. On that Saturday, I lamented to my friend <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/">Jen</a> that what I really wanted to do was write and speak. She suggested that the quickest path to that end was to write a book. “I could write a book about HTML,” I said, “but does there really need to be another one of those?” Two days later on Monday, I find myself at the Great British Booze Up. Mysterious promptings to talk to a guy who was upstairs put me squarely in the path of my friend <a href="http://www.rhjr.net">Robert</a> and his editor <a href="http://sarahwynde.blogspot.com">Wendy</a>. That conversation lead to a book deal with PeachPit, and my writing <cite>The CSS Detective Guide</cite>.</p><p>Fast forward to April 2010. My book has been released, and I was feeling euphoric with the accomplishment of one of my life’s dreams of being an author. Curiosity led me to check the Future of Web Design’s website for their upcoming event in May. My stomach flipped when I saw that the speaker for the presentation “The Graceful Degradation of CSS3” was TBD. I contacted them and offered myself as a speaker, and they said yes! Thus, my defacto speaking career was born.</p><p>Fast forward to today, November 2012. I know I certainly don’t speak or travel as much as a lot of people, but I am still proud that this life is something that I deliberately created. When I look at it in this light, I feel enormously empowered and powerful. I look back at the past several years of ways that I have changed my life dramatically for the better, and almost exactly the way in which I’d hoped, and I realize that I really do have the power to create whatever it is in my life that I wish for. This gives me an immense amount of hope about what I’m currently focused on bringing into my life in the near future!</p><p>So, be honest with yourself about your wishes and hopes and start making them happen. If I can do it, then anyone can.</p>
