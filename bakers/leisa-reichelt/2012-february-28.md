I expect people think it's a compliment when they say 'I don't' know how you find the time ...'. Personally, I
find it a little irritating. We all have the same amount of time, and we all choose what we do with that
time. 

If you don't understand how people find time to do all the things they do then chances are you're not being
very thoughtful about the way you spend your time. What you do, what you don't do - that's your choice. 

There is no good choice or bad choice, but there are different levels of thoughtfulness.

There are lots of ways to spend your time badly. You can be incredibly busy and still spending your time
badly. Everybody, except the bored, wants more time.

What do you want your life to be? That's how you need to spend your time.

Your time is the most precious resource you have. Use it thoughtfully, productively and creatively.
