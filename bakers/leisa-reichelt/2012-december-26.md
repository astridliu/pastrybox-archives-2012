Don’t give up.Don’t let yourself be convinced that this is just the way it has to be.Don’t stop asking
questions.Do ask for what you need to do the job well.Do trust your instincts and your experience.

Pay attention to red flags.Work with people who care.Conduct experiments.Don’t take yourself too
seriously.Remember that confidence and competence are not always related.Always be learning.

Ask dumb questions.Maintain naivety.Be able to explain what you’re doing to a five year old.Make sure you
know why you’re doing it.

Your life is a design project.There are many possible solutions.Don’t just accept the default settings, be
creative, imagine alternatives.

Don’t give up.
