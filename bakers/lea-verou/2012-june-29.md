Contrary to popular belief, the defining characteristic of a good professional, in any discipline, is not the
ability to blurt out good ideas off the top of their head. It’s perseverance and not being easily satisfied.
Where the others would stop, they keep going. For example, when writing CSS, they won’t stop after they’ve
achieved a certain style. They will also try to make it more flexible, more maintainable, simpler. Next week,
try this: When you’re about to give up and proclaim that something is “done”, try to spend five
more minutes on the task, thinking how you can improve it further, how to make it more elegant. I think it
will help you be much more satisfied and proud of your work.
