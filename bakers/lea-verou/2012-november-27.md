I bet that many years from now, the memories that will make us smile won’t be those of us being cowards.
Neither will they be the hours of debugging pesky code or bikeshedding in meetings. It will be the
transgressions, the passion, the risks, all those times we stepped out of our comfort zones and took a leap in
the dark. Those times when our life was turned upside down and we didn’t know what tomorrow would bring.
Sometimes it leads us to fall on our face, but the regret is only temporary. Deep down we knew it from the
very beginning: We’re proud about ourselves, because we dared, and boy, did we enjoy the ride! I’m always
wary of complacency. Comfort is not what we’ll remember if we get too old to make new leaps. Those who call
you foolish today are the ones who will regret not having lived tomorrow. It’s never too late to switch
sides.
