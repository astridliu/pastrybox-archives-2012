People often think it’s hard to change my mind, that I’m too fixated on my own opinions. The reason I give
this impression is that I will fiercely defend them. However, I will only do so until I see compelling
arguments for the other side. I always try to keep an open mind to being wrong, and it has only made me
better.

In the past few months I’ve been witnessing myself slowly change my views regarding yet another major life
issue: The place I want to live in. Moving to the US has been a life goal for me ever since I first visited,
almost fifteen years ago. However, as I spend more time there and get closer to moving, I’ve started
noticing things that I don’t like so much. I’ve tried to ignore them, but they keep being there, giving me
the finger like dead pixels on a brand new screen. I might go forward with it anyway, or I might pick another
country, but this is yet another experience that has taught me to avoid being dogmatic.

We are all, and should be, subject to change. Whoever insists in their rigid convictions reminds me of
software whose bugs never get fixed. You are the only maintainer of that software. Be vigilant enough to
discover and fix your own bugs. Be open-minded enough to listen to other people’s bug reports about it. Most
people forget to do this after a certain age. They become so arrogant that they think they don’t have any
more bugs to fix, or so insecure that they believe they can’t fix any more. That’s the turning point where
the years that pass by start to become “aging”, instead of “growing up”. Aging
doesn’t have to do with how long you’re on this planet, it has to do with giving up on yourself. To stop
being subject to change is to start being stagnant.
