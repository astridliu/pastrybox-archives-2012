Many people e-mail me asking about freelancing directly after finishing school. If there is one thing that I
would highly recommend, it’s getting some experience first. When I look back, it was a mistake to start
freelancing so early, because I had no idea what I got myself into. I struggled for about 4 years to get on
the right track, because the people who promised me work didn’t deliver. That’s why I would
recommend working a few years in a few agencies to see how things are done, so you get a feel for how projects
are run, what’s involved etc. Experience is very important. Once you feel you have reached that level of
knowledge, you could start freelancing after-hours. Start smaller and gradually grow until it reaches a level
of maturity that could sustain a daily income. Before you start freelancing completely set aside some savings,
because the first few years will be difficult.
