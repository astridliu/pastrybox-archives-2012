Working with truly talented people is something I’ve always wanted in my career. Like playing tennis
with someone who is better than me, working with someone who knows more and can do more raises *my* game. And
few things are more inspirational to me than witnessing (and being able to contribute to) great work.

But talent doesn’t trump a bad attitude or inconsistent work ethic.

No matter how skilled someone is… no matter how incredible their final work is… no matter how
great their technical reputation is… If that person is an ass, I don’t want to work with them. If
that person can’t follow through, I *won’t* work with them.

True talent may be rare, and it is unquestionably an asset to any endeavor. But someone I can count on, who
works well with others, is invaluable.
