Project delays. They are simply a reality. Sometimes the client changes requirements. Sometimes a server
problem becomes a time-suck. Sometimes a bug gets the better of a developer.

What *isn’t* a reality is that a project delay equals an angry or lost client … as long as you
honestly communicate with that client.

When a client wants to make changes that will affect the project scope, it is *my responsibility* to tell them
that. It isn’t always about saying “no,” it’s about saying “yes, but this will
affect the timeline and budget.” When a client is delayed on their tasks, it is *my responsibility* to
remind them how it will affect the timeline. When these things happen, I’m not doing my job if I pretend
that the project will still launch when we originally planned.

It isn’t easy to say “no,” or “yes, but …”. It isn’t easy to inform
a client a project will be delayed. Sometimes clients get (initially) upset. But I guarantee they will be
really angry when they find out, a week before launch date, that the project is going to be delayed, just
because no one wanted to tell them about the realities.

Honest communication is part of my job. It not only shows respect for the client and project, but respect for
my own business. I want my clients to trust me, even if what I have to tell them isn’t the best news.
Trust and honesty build goodwill, even amidst a project delay. And goodwill, combined with delivering a great
final product (of course), means referrals and repeat business.
