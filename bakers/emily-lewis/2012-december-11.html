       <p>Project delays. They are simply a reality. Sometimes the client changes requirements. Sometimes a server problem becomes a time-suck. Sometimes a bug gets the better of a developer.</p><p>What <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a reality is that a project delay equals an angry or lost client &hellip; as long as you honestly communicate with that client.</p><p>When a client wants to make changes that will affect the project scope, it is <em>my responsibility</em> to tell them that. It isn&rsquo;t always about saying &ldquo;no,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s about saying &ldquo;yes, but this will affect the timeline and budget.&rdquo; When a client is delayed on their tasks, it is <em>my responsibility</em> to remind them how it will affect the timeline. When these things happen, I&rsquo;m not doing my job if I pretend that the project will still launch when we originally planned.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t easy to say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes, but &hellip;&rdquo;. It isn&rsquo;t easy to inform a client a project will be delayed. Sometimes clients get (initially) upset. But I guarantee they will be really angry when they find out, a week before launch date, that the project is going to be delayed, just because no one wanted to tell them about the realities.</p><p>Honest communication is part of my job. It not only shows respect for the client and project, but respect for my own business. I want my clients to trust me, even if what I have to tell them isn&rsquo;t the best news. Trust and honesty build goodwill, even amidst a project delay. And goodwill, combined with delivering a great final product (of course), means referrals and repeat business.</p>
