A little advice for those that freelance or run a design studio. When someone asks you if you’re
interested in a project, the answer is “yes” 99% of the time. Don’t decide based on the
referrer’s understanding of timeframe, budget, or any of the project requirements. Take the opportunity
to talk to the prospective client; give yourself the chance to sell your own terms. After all, if those
clients really want to work with you, you never know how flexible they’re willing to be.
