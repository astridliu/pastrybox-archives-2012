Experience broadens your perspective and makes you better at what you do, though you must be awake to new
ideas that can come from even the most mundane meeting and seemingly-unrelated chance encounter. Routine can
help you be productive, but boredom can dull your senses. Take every opportunity you can to travel. Exploit
every opportunity you have to meet new people and ask them about their ideas: what's most important to them in
their work? How did they devise this? A walk in the park at lunch time can change you, provided you're open to
examining what you see and experience. Be reflective, be thoughtful. Question yourself, your motives, your
work. Write about these things: be it on a public or private blog or in a journal. To me, this is the only way
to keep getting better at what I do.Â
