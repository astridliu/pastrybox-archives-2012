You only live once. Remember that. Don’t let your days, hours, and minutes slip through like grains of
sand through the hourglass. Build the site, make that pet project that’s been bouncing around in your
head. Write the article. Write the book. Learn that skill. Share it with others. Be intentional. Set goals.
Push yourself. If the thought of making or doing something fills you with fear, you must do it. Trepidation
signals an opportunity for growth and learning. And, if you don’t shoot, you don’t score, right?
