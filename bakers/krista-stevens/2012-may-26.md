In The Elements of Style, Strunk and White caution writers to *omit needless words.*  While Strunk and White
wrote this advice for writers and editors, consider how you might apply the concept to your life and your
work. Consider the following:

 *   Omit needless meetings

 *  Omit needless commitments

 *  Omit needless distractions

 *   Omit waste

How would your life, work, and productivity improve if you applied this simple thought? What is needless in
your life and work? Omit it.
