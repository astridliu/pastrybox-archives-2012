Each day we run across interesting articles and blog posts that we send to read-later apps and post to
Pinboard. How do you keep track of all these items? Do you keep track of these bits of knowledge, amusement,
and ephemera? Do they reside in the apps, or do you control them? All these internet curiosities are important
to me; they mark time in a too busy life, and deserve to be catalogued. While I love reading apps, read-later
apps, and Pinboard, I’ve come to post snippets, quotes, and things I want to remember in a WordPress
blog so that I can keep track of what I find, reflect on what I’ve read and what these shiny bits mean
to me and to my work. Do you collect shiny bits, too? If so, how?
