Working on the web is tremendously exciting. I believe that the concept of open source has the power to change
the world. I know of no other industry where people routinely create things and give them away, with the hope
that someone will take what they made, make it better, and release it back into the world to repeat that
cycle.

We need to go beyond teaching our kids to read, write, calculate, and think. We need to teach them markup and
how to code.
