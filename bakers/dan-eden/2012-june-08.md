I had the overwhelming honor of speaking at Webshaped in Helsinki this year. I had a fantastic time in a
beautiful city, and I was sad to leave. As I waited in the airport, I noticed these huge stickers on the
floor: 

FINNISH DESIGN

DESIGN GALLERY

I followed them, and sure enough I was led to a big, open room filled with chairs designed by various Finns.
Weird, wonderful inventions. “SIT DOWN; SEIZE THE MOMENT” is plastered on the wall. I’m too afraid to
actually sit on account of the security guards, so I continue to admire from a safe distance.

At the back of the room is a board filled with the profiles of the designers, as well as headphones dangling
from the ceiling. But they weren't headphones at all—they were ear protectors. The idea was to take these
ear protectors, go and sit down and just enjoy the deafening silence. It’s wonderful that something like
this exists in an airport, or anywhere at all. 

I turn around and notice one last thing—hundreds of sticky notes on a far wall. I walk up. They’re from
the people who sat and listened to the silence. Tales of their experience. I looked over all the strange
messages on the wall, and one in particular stood out to me.

Life is just beautiful.

I told this to a [friend](https://twitter.com/#!/nrrrdcore) and she put it into the words I was struggling to
find:

> Life has such an awesome way of reminding us of these things. Like it’s
> rewarding us for paying attention. The most beautiful user-experience.

Put down your phone every once in a while. Always look up. Follow suspicious signs.
