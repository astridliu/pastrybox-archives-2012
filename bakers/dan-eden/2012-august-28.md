I’m terrible at accepting money for my work. Well, put another way—I’m terrible at accepting
money for the work I enjoy. Most of the websites I’ve worked on have been for friends, family, or
respected peers, and when it comes to invoicing, I tend to ‘forget’ or apply heavy discounts. That
needs to stop. It makes me value my work less. It makes the client value the work less. It makes it easily
replaceable. And it doesn’t pay the bills.

Don’t chicken out of asking for money. Your client knows the worth of your work. And you should too.
(Not working with friends & family helps here.)
