My front-facing portfolio only shows about 20% of all the work I've ever done. Why? Because the rest is crap.
We web designers are changing the world around usâ€”it's up to us to provide the quality control. We can make
a huge difference with our work, and it's up to us how good a difference that is.

Don't design crap. And when you do, let it go. Shove it away where no one can see it but you, and let it
remind you where you once were and where you're headed. Keep that bar high.
