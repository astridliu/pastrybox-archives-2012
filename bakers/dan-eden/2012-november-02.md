“User” is a funny word. When we hear it, we remember watching Tron for the first time and thinking how
unnatural it felt to have humans described as “users”. At least, I do. You might imagine an “average”
person. Blue jeans and a t-shirt. But a person nonetheless.

The problem with describing our customers as “users” is that it generalises too much. We can’t afford to
generalise in this business. Generalising is the opposite of “user”-friendly. The opposite of responsive
design. The opposite of design. People have different needs. Every single person on Earth will take away a
different experience from your website. Successful design is a different experience, but similar knowledge
takeaway. And you don’t achieve that through generalising, but through a larger scope of delivery.

We can’t afford to think about just one device, or one browser, or even one target audience. As soon as you
do, you present the possibility of failure to your website.
