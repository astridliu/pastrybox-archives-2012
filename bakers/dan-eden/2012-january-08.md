The most important thing you can do in this industry—or indeed any line of work—is be nice. Be grateful
for the work and thoughts of others. Take the time out to send a nice email to your idol. Reply to all your
emails. Most importantly, take the time out to help those who need it, whether it's writing a line of code or
giving feedback on their work. It pays not to be an ass.
