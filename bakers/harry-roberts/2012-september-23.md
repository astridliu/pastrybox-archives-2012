I tend to bug fix solely in Firebug and then port any changes over to my actual CSS file once I deem a bug
fixed. Quite often, however, I get so far into the work that I totally forget I actually need to move the
Firebug code over. I’ve actually marked bugs as complete and committed code without realising my
‘fixes’ were not actually in there. Firebug is a gift and a curse for
me…``</muppet>``
