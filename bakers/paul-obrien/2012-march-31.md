I’m mourning the passing of IE6.

It’s not that I like IE6 or like coding for it but I’ve spent my whole life learning all those hacks,
tricks, tips and other nonsense fixes to beat it into submission. I used to wear my hacks as a badge and took
pride in getting IE6 to behave in situations where others couldn’t. Now that time has passed and I feel like
I’m in mourning. I have all that knowledge sitting in my brain waiting to burst out but with nowhere to
go.

When I code now, I write rules that I know will work and be interpreted correctly by the more modern browsers
but where’s the fun in that? 

You know what I say?

To * html with it all...
