       <p>Drew and I were chatting over breakfast one Thursday about a significant feature addition for our product, <a href="http://grabaperch.com">Perch</a>. We decided that the idea was good, fulfilled some customer requests and that we should build it. By the end of the day on Friday we <a href="http://grabaperch.com/blog/archive/scheduled-tasks-and-build-your-own-dashboard-widgets">shipped the feature</a>. Less than 48 hours after our conversation.</p><p>Such is the joy of a small team, a team in touch with those who use and love our product. We frequently have a discussion with a customer in the forum, like their idea for a feature and immediately implement it. There is great satisfaction in posting back to let a customer know that the feature they needed has been shipped.</p><p>Being in touch with our customers helps us to quickly react to their requirements. Understanding and caring about changes in trends and best practice in our industry helps us to create features that support the latest ways of working. As a bootstrapped product we have no investors to keep happy. The Perch roadmap is decided in the discussions between me, Drew and our customers. I can&rsquo;t imagine doing it any other way.</p>
