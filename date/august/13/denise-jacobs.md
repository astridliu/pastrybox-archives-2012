Don’t compromise professionally because something feels “safe”—for example, by taking a
job that doesn’t fit or doing work that you don’t particularly like to do. If the fit isn’t
there, trust that something even better is coming, and probably sooner rather than later. Stay true to
yourself and your vision for yourself.

Also, trust that what may seem like a “missed” opportunity is probably just a different
opportunity in disguise. You never know what is happening in the grand scheme of things in your life—what
may feel like a huge disappointment you’ll probably realize is a blessing later. A seemingly promising
path that looks like it stops at a dead end can be the foundation for pointing you in a direction that you
hadn’t considered before.

In essence: Trust and follow your vision—it wants you as much as you want it. Listen to your gut. Stay
positive and stay open.
