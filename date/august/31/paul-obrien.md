Are we there yet?

I’ve just realised it’s been a while since someone argued that “tables (for layout)” were better than
CSS so are we finally turning the corner?

“Tables v CSS” was the stable fodder for many heated forum discussions but I don’t remember seeing a
similar discussion recently. Did CSS win or did the opponents become extinct?

Or did they move onto html4 v html5 battles instead?
