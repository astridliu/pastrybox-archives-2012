       <p>My dad emailed me over the weekend, to ask if I&rsquo;d seen <a href="http://lingscars.com/">lingscars.com</a>. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to make of it—should he laugh or despair? I, of course, had seen it before.  <a href="http://twitter.com/philhawksworth">Phil Hawksworth</a>uses it in his talks where he discusses over-using bells and whistles, and being careful using piles of JavaScript.</p><p>I emailed my dad back, and told him that yes, it&rsquo;s done the rounds, and yes it&rsquo;s still successful. It struck me that it didn&rsquo;t actually matter what I thought past that though—it&rsquo;s awful in an aesthetic sense, but so what? It clearly gets them business. In the same week, I&rsquo;d come across something I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while—because I have Flash disabled—a website with music! It was using <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>. Infuriating, because that&rsquo;s exactly the sort of feature I disliked about the &ldquo;old&rdquo; web and was blocking for, and it was back using modern, better, technologies—but what did I really expect would happen? That website creators across the internet would simultaneously stop wanting jingles on their website just because we&rsquo;d switched the technology on them?</p><p>We might be pushing out proprietary technologies like Flash, replacing them with the open web-friendly options like video, audio and WebGL, but we&rsquo;re not changing expectations from users about how websites should actually look and behave—what&rsquo;s annoying, what teaches users to be fooled, what puts them off, what&rsquo;s fun. The question for me is really will this class of website, like Ling&rsquo;s Cars, always exist and will we always just write them off without learning about why they still work for a large set of our audiences?</p>
