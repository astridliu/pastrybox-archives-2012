We all teach from time to time, whether it’s explaining something to a colleague, writing a blog post about
the cool CSS technique we discovered, or giving a technical talk. If you are serious about becoming better at
it, I’d strongly recommend reading up on psychology and neuroscience. If you don’t have the time to,
here’s one fact that I’ve found most useful: Humans have incredibly impressive pattern recognition skills.
We use them in pretty much everything we do, from learning our native language as kids, to escaping predators
in the wild. 

How does that help you teach more effectively? In one word: Examples, examples, examples. No matter how good
you are at explaining the rules, nothing beats a few good examples of their application in practice. Our
abstract thinking is not nearly as good as our pattern recognition skills.

However, don’t be fooled into thinking that theory is useless. Often, multiple explanations fit a given
example. The theory helps us pick the one that fits, which might not be the one we initially recognized.

I’ve found that this principle applies to pretty much everything I’ve taught or have been taught, from
mathematics to natural and programming languages. You can forget the theory, but you should never forget the
examples.
