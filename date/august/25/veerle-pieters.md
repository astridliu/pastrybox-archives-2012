It seems that these days if you receive an e-mail with “Let me know if you would be interested…”
that people expect you to answer if you’re not interested as well, because a day or 2 later I get a
“we didn’t hear back from you…” e-mail. I’m talking about the e-mails where certain
services are presented to you (SEO, IT companies, and the likes). I get too many of these kind of e-mails, on
top of my pile that actually matter to me. I’ll be honest. If I get such e-mail, and they also start
with “Hello” I simply delete them. People who send e-mails like that should realize that if they
don’t get an e-mail back from you, it means the person isn’t interested. After all, they ask you
to e-mail back only “in case you are interested”. Sending an e-mail with “we didn't hear
back from you…” sounds very pushy and will only result in the opposite of what you’ve hoped for.
