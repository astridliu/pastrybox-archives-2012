Design is a question before itâ€™s an answer.

Great designers should be asking questions of each other and of those who receive our designs and use our
designs or we run the great risk of designing from within the structure and limit of our own thinking. We are
translators. We seek to make simple and obvious what once felt obscure and abstract. We do this by listening
and then synthesizing what we hear into a coherent picture.
