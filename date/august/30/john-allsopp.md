# Artefacts

Photographs make for very big image files. Luckily, they can also compress significantly, with very little
noticeable decrease in image quality (well, at least on lower resolution screens, weâ€™ll see what impact
higher resolution screens have on just how much we can compress images in future).

But compress too far, and suddenly artefacts appear, the unavoidable fingerprint of a particular technology.
We see (and hear) this elsewhere, with 3D rendering engines, audio formats, everywhere we emulate the organic
world, the analogue world with digital technology.

I sometimes wonder though whether these artefacts are bugs, or should we treat them as features? Why do we see
the organic as the ideal, and the synthetic, the digital as less pure, less real?

Increasingly, our lives are lived through digital experiences, film (often not simply a compression of the
real world, but a purely digital emulation of it), and music (which often is digitally generated and
reproduced).

Years ago, Hip Hop DJs embraced the scratch, an artefact of mixing using turntables and vinyl, and created an
entirely new sound.

I wonder ultimately what artefacts of the digital age will transcend their status as bugs, and become features
of digital media? If any?
