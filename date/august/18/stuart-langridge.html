       <p>Changing the world is within your grasp.</p><p>This is not necessarily a good thing.</p><p>If you go around and talk to normal people, it becomes clear that, weirdly, they don&rsquo;t ever imagine how to get ten million dollars. They don&rsquo;t think about new ways to redesign a saucepan or the buttons in their car. They don&rsquo;t contemplate why sending a parcel is slow and how it could be a slicker process. They don&rsquo;t think about <em>ways to change the world</em>.</p><p>I find it hard to talk to someone who doesn&rsquo;t think like that.</p><p>To an engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and feature-poor toys, as Scott Adams once put it. To a designer, the world is full of bad design. And to both, it is not only possible but at a high level <em>obvious</em> how to (a) fix it (b) for everyone (c) and make a few million out of doing so.</p><p>At first, this seems a blessing: you can see how the world could be better! And make it happen!</p><p>Then it&rsquo;s a curse. Those normal people I mentioned? Short of winning the lottery or Great Uncle Brewster dying, there&rsquo;s no possibility of becoming a multi-millionaire, and so they&rsquo;re not thinking about it. Doors that have a handle on them but say &ldquo;Push&rdquo; are not a source of distress. Wrong kerning in signs is not like sandpaper on <em>their</em> nerves.</p><p>The curse of being able to change the world isâ€¦ the frustration that you have so far failed to do so.</p><p>Perhaps there is a Zen thing here. Some people have managed it. Maybe you have. So the world is better, and that&rsquo;s a good thing all by itself, right? </p>
