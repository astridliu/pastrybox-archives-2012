At our recent [Insites: Xmas Special](http://viewportindustries.com/blog/insites-the-xmas-special/) I spoke
about the three things that signify 2012 for me. They are:

 *  Collaboration — I am a firm believer that the sum of the parts are nearly always greater than the
individuals. Finding and choosing good collaborators isn’t easy but it’s very worthwhile. They
spur you on, make you raise the bar and bring skills to your projects you don’t have. Here’s to
more collaborations in 2013.

 *  Shipping — 2012 was a year of a lot of talk but also a lot of action. There’s no better feeling
than getting a project or product out of the door. I hope the trend continues in 2013.

 *  Community — We live in a digital age but increasingly feel isolated. 2012 was full of great events,
meet-ups and spur-of-the-moment coffees with like minded people. It’s a great opportunity to share
issues, problems and generally add the personal side to our digital industry. 2013 kicks off with a trip to
Nottingham for NA Conf, see you there?
