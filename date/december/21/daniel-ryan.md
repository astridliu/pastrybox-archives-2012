Change happens in our industry when enough folks embrace something new. This can be seen in the past few years
as many of us have embraced HTML5, responsive design, web fonts, etc. The next shift we need to bring about
isnâ€™t a new technology or technique, it is embracing diversity in our industry. We need to actively
become more inclusive in our workplaces, our conferences and our professional organizations. Gender and ethnic
diversity should be our resolution for 2013 and beyond.
