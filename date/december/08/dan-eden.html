       <p>Some time around the start of The Pastry Box Project, my life changed quite drastically. This was down to a few things: the realisation that everything is designed. The freeing up of a lot of my &ldquo;free time.&rdquo; Most significantly, the idea that I could do anything I wanted, provided I was motivated enough. I could change my sleeping pattern so I was more productive. I could read more books. I could learn something new every day. I could create a product I previously thought to be impossible. I could impress my peers and heroes, get a job I was passionate about, and move to a place I love with a person I love. I could do all that, and the first step was waking up earlier.</p><p>So I did. Not out of choice, at first. I had a job to go to. So I&rsquo;d get up at 6am and go to work and get back home about 6pm. Then those 12 other hours were for resting. But I could squeeze more life out of those hours. So I worked some more. I worked on Brills and Animate.css. I learned more about PHP and CSS and other things that in X years time will be obsolete. Thinking about the temporary nature of my craft motivated me to learn more about something less temporary — its roots. The foundations of design. Typography, grid systems, color theory. So I bought books. And I learned more. I hated reading, but it was easy to read about something I was genuinely passionate about. The &ldquo;why,&rdquo; not the &ldquo;how,&rdquo; was teaching me to be better at my craft.</p><p>As I sit and wonder how best to sustain my latest product, I find it hard to care about its profitability. I was never in this for the money. It&rsquo;s completely bewildering to me to think that there are people out there who will genuinely work their entire lives just to make a living. Or even worse, people who put a minimal amount of effort into a product they simply don&rsquo;t care about just so they can flip a profit. I&rsquo;m incredibly lucky that from a young age, I&rsquo;ve found something I&rsquo;m passionate about that just so happens to be an ever-growing industry that pays pretty well, too. Others might not have that chance. They may have to work to live. But the only way they&rsquo;ll find that passion for something is by looking for it. Not by saying &ldquo;maybe next year.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve said it before. Happiness and success isn&rsquo;t a measure of how much money you have, or the clients you managed to work with.</p><p>Passion is the best motivator. Working on something you love — something that you need — is incredibly fulfilling. If you&rsquo;re passionate about something, you&rsquo;ll stay up late working on it because you want to. You&rsquo;ll never stop making it better. All you need for your idea to be successful is a genuine need and a genuine passion. Success relies on your use of the product, no one else&rsquo;s. This was your idea. Make it. Use it. If you don&rsquo;t use it, it&rsquo;s not good enough. If you don&rsquo;t know how to build it, learn how. Ship early and ship often. Keep it simple. Never say &ldquo;finished.&rdquo; Make mistakes. Be honest. Don&rsquo;t try to be the next big thing. Be the better thing.</p><p>I am more productive. I do read more books. I do learn something new every day. I have created a product I previously thought to be impossible. I will impress my peers and heroes, get a job I&rsquo;m passionate about, and move to a place I love with a person I love. I&rsquo;m not finished. I&rsquo;m just getting started.</p>
