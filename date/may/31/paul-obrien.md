Let’s design a car that has square wheels and no windows because it will look really cool. Then let’s put
the steering wheel on one side of the car and the foot pedals on the other side of the car. While we’re at
it let’s forget to put a door on it so that you can’t actually get in to drive.

Now let’s give the design to the mechanic and tell him to build it.

It’s a sure bet he will tell you where to put your designs in no uncertain terms. Why is it then that
designers/clients feel they can take the same approach to building a website? Mysterious unfathomable menus,
text too small for the human eye to read and graphics the size of a bus.

I should stick to my guns and tell them to change the design, and although I complain about it at the start, I
usually end up coding it much like the client wanted from the start. So the next time you visit a site and
can’t work out how to navigate and where the text is too small to read then that will be my fault!
