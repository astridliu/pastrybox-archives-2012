I'm not following any trends, I'm just trying to do my own thing. If people say you can't use rounded corners
anymore because they are overused, that type of info doesn't have any value for me. If I'm working on
something that I feel is better suited with rounded corners I will use them, trendy or not. Just like with
anything else, I feel it is okay if it fits the project or when used in moderation. That's why I almost never
look at web site galleries, because they often kill inspiration.
