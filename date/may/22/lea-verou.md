I never make long-term plans. Life is an unpredictable adventure. Concrete plans restrict this amazing
journey. Stressing over a series of mental checkboxes you need to check until a certain date shifts your focus
away from making awesomeness. I have long-term dreams instead, and they are all the compass I need. They give
me the drive to constantly strive to improve, while still allowing room for surprises. I learned to trust
chaos, and so far, I was never disappointed.
