Somehow, I keep managing to forget the benefit of switching off. Not checking email. Letting that iPad stay on
the table. Every time I do switch off for a while—perhaps even just a weekend—I feel so much better
prepared to go back into work. I feel rested. And yet I'll forget this feeling, go back to being connected
nearly all the time, and suddenly be reminded of how great disconnection is once I try it the next time. This
is a reminder to myself and to others to switch off way more often than we do. I'm going to try and not touch
email at weekends from now on.
