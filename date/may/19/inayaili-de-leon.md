I would be curious to know how design discussions, reviews, brainstorms, happen within other teams. Few things
are more fascinating than seeing the process other designers go through to get to their results, but the
documentation is often limited to iterations of visual prototypes. I wish there was a way to listen to the
discussions, the argumentation, the things people say when an idea is still evolving, or when someone strikes
gold.
