You may catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, but you catch even more with a little audacity. Being
polite is a good rule of thumb, but like everything, it also needs moderation. Don't say "share my content
pleeeeeeaaaase". It makes people think your content isn't worthy of sharing if you have to grovel. In a long
email, don't write a paragraph apologizing for its length (true story!). Being overly polite when meeting
someone, categorizes yourself as inferior in the other person's subconscious. Treat yourself with the respect
and admiration you expect from other people. If you don't think highly of yourself, nobody will. When meeting
someone you admire, treat them as an equal and they're more likely to do the same.

However, be careful not to cross the fine distinction between treating yourself with respect and being a cocky
jackass. Treat others as equals, not as inferiors, otherwise your attitude will get you nowhere â€” and will
piss everyone off along the way.
