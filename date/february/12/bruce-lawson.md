The Web should be consumable by all, but it should also be easy to author. Publishing tools like WordPress
enable millions to author sites, and can produce high-quality code, but it's still essential that it's easy to
hand-author HTML. Not everything can be simple, but it should be as simple as possible. That's why I support
HTML5 - it simplifies authoring by making some previously-scripted effects declarative (form validation,
controls for video and audio) and provides simple APIs where previously complex script was required - eg,
localstorage APIs.
