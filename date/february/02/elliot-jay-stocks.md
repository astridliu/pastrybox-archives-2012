Having just returned from [New Adventures in Web Design 2012](http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/), in
Nottingham, England, I find myself reminded once again of the good friends I have in this industry. Kind,
intelligent, funny, and inspiring friends who originally came together over our shared love of the web and
design in general. Every time we meet it's like the conversation carries on from the previous event. The
presence of friends at conferences makes each new city feel like home; each new speaker session a shared
learning experience of furthering our collective craft. What other industry has this? This sense of
camaraderie, this bind of community?

I was once asked, in a room full of such friends, at the .Net Awards three years ago, 'aren't you guys all
competitors?' Technically, yes, but I don't think any of us see our industry like that. There's enough work to
go around. Collaboration, not competition, is the driving force behind what we do.

At events like New Adventures, I'm reminded of just how fortunate we are to work as web designers. What an
amazing community. What a [Great Bunch Of Lads](http://greatbunchoflads.com/).
