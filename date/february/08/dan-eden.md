I recently went through a major creative drought. For about a month and a half, I had absolutely no fresh
ideas; I found myself recreating the designs of others, and practicing CSS techniques just to feel productive.
It was pretty depressing, particularly after such success with Animate.css.

Then one day, I thought I'd try something I've never done before, and create an icon set. It was difficult,
since it had been a very long time since I even opened Photoshop, and I've never worked so intensely on such a
small canvas or with the pen tool - but it really kicked me into gear.

I found that by throwing myself into the deep end of unknown waters, I got a great burst of motivation, which
suppressed my feelings of doubt about my ability to design in an unusual environment. If you're ever suffering
from designer's block, try something completely different. You might be surprised how well it works out.
