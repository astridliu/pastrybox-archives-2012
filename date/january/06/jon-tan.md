Just before Christmas I saw [a BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16301048) where a
man in Ireland found a letter written to Santa by his mother, when she was 10 years old, 100 years ago. When I
saw her handwriting in the photo, it seemed like a part of her was embedded into the faded, yellowed paper.
The artefact felt like an extension of her. In a world where we type more than write, I wondered how I could
embed a facsimile of that physical connection into my work on Mapalong. I wondered if, in a hundred years
time, the data people create now could have the same resonance that hand written letters do, today.
