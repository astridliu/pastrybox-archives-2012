As an open source lead, I communicate a metric shit-ton on a daily basis. There are folks who have problems,
folks who want to help, and everything in between. One of the hardest problems I have is dealing with
contributors who live half a world away, speak English as a second language at best, and with whom my entire
relationship is text-based. I can't tell you how many times I've either hurt somebody's feelings or been
inadvertently offended due to the inability to translate body language and linguistic nuances to text.
