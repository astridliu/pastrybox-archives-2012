I like working with start ups because they are brave. Sometimes too brave, of course, but unlike most big
companies they are likely to have a vision for how the world might be different when their project is in that
world, and everyone on the team knows and shares that vision.

There comes a time in almost every company's existence when people start to care more about their career than
they do the product they're working on or the customers they're serving. This is when the fear seems to kick
in.

Don't be one of those companies and try not to work for them.

They are vision vacuums. In this vacuum you are better off making no decision than making the
wrong one. That's no way to be creative.
