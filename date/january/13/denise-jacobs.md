My main preoccupation these days is the intersection or nexus point of creativity, innovation, and
productivity. There are so many more tools and capacities on and with the web now, that I feel that we can
start to shift our focus away from the “how?” and start focusing more on the “how better/improved?”
and “how different?” and really zero in on methods to get to those answers consistently, faster, and with
less effort.
