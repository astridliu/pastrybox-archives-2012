Eleven years ago, I taught my first workshop on XHTML. It quickly became clear that outside of what was spec'd
and implemented, the only answer I'd have for business case, use case or real-world pragmatic questions was "I
don't know." Now I teach HTML5 workshops, and find myself confronted by the same questions, especially in
regards to APIs, storage, and security.

The answer is still "I don't know." People refer to me as an expert. The truth is, the only thing I'm expert
at is not knowing! At its essence, this is perhaps the ongoing fascination for those of us working the
ever-changing Web. We don't know. Every day is a new adventure, every project an opportunity to learn. Out of
this experience, I've learned we workers of the Web should be proud of all the things we don't know, because
it opens up a literal world of opportunity and discovery.
