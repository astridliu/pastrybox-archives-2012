The whole of communication technology is merely an extension of pigment on surface, the fundamental technique
of indirect language transmission. Radio and television and computers do more work for us, sure. They parse
ideas into shapes and colors and sounds. But there is nothing they can do that can’t be recreated with a
lump of mud and a fertile imagination, a method as viable today as it was five thousand years ago.

The only thing more amazing and beautiful than how far we’ve come is that we haven’t come very far at
all.
