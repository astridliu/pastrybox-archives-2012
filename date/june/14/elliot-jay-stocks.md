I'm seeing an increasing rise in people blogging and tweeting in opposition to responsive web design. Some are
[intelligent discussions](http://howells.ws/posts/view/128/my-collected-opinions-on-responsive-web-design)
about the challenges it poses, but sadly most are simply knee-jerk reactions from frustrated designers and
developers who don't get the concept and are [angered at the extra time
required](http://managewp.com/5-reasons-why-responsive-design-is-not-worth-it) to work in this new way.

Fixed-widths were always a hack; always a temporary measure. [As Andy Clarke
said](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/i_dont_care_about_responsive_web_design), responsive web design
is web design. Attempting to remain in a world of fixed-width layouts is futile, so — please — let's stop
trying to come up with half-baked arguments against it.
