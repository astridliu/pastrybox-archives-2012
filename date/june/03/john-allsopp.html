       <p>When I say web&#8230;</p><p>As might be apparent by now, I try to think a lot about where the web is now, but also where it is going (which really boils down to the question &#8220;what is the web anyway?&#8221; in a lot of ways).<p>So I'm always interested in exploring new devices, ways of interacting, both in practice and in theory.<p>What&#8217;s interesting in these conversations is often very experienced technologists think of the web and the browser more or less interchangeably. Which constrains the possibilities of the web as a medium tremendously.</p><p>In a similar vein, just as it has been for the last decade or more, indeed since the web transitioned from an academic tool to a more popular medium in the mid 1990s, our focus on what the web is, and might be, is typically almost entirely visual. </p><p>Of course this is a fundamental aspect of the web, but the web is not exclusively a visual medium. Nor is it exclusively a human-driven medium. Increasingly our interactions with the web are, and will be, passive (as I discussed in my <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/john-allsopp/2012-january-10/">first Pastrybox entry</a> back in January). Indeed, increasingly it won&#8217;t be humans, but our built environment, our buildings and vehicles, the environment itself, that drives the web.  </p><p>So when you think of the web, when you talk about the web, train yourself to go beyond fonts and colors and responsiveness. </p><p>Play with some of the emerging low-cost, easy to program sensor devices like <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/">Ninja Blocks</a>, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermechanical/twine-listen-to-your-world-talk-to-the-internet">Twine</a>, and others. Investigate the APIs that are in mobile devices, accessible to web developers via <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.7.0/index.html">phoneGap</a>, or on platforms like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211377.aspx">Windows8</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/">RIM's TabletOS and upcoming BB10 phone OS</a>.</p><p>When I say web, I&#8217;m not 100% sure what I mean, but I know it goes far beyond the browser. </p>
