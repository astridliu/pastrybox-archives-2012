If you’re a designer and want to endear yourself to a front-end developer, work on a grid. A real grid.
Not just some guides you threw together in Photoshop. It doesn’t have to be one of the popular ones,
just put your design on an actual grid. It makes our lives, and I’d have to assume yours as well, much
easier.
