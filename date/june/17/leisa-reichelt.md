Do you know, specifically, the kind of work you want to be doing? The kind of people you want to be working
with? The kind of customers you want to be looking after?

I’m amazed how many people reach out to me when they’re looking for work but, when I ask them,
what kind of work are you looking for, I get a blank stare.

Sure, sometimes you might need to take work you’d rather not be doing, but you should always know
clearly what you want (even if this changes from time to time).

Same thing goes for my clients. They are often so busy trying to make a sale, or raise some money,
they’ve lost their vision. They’ve forgotten the real reason their organisation exists.

Once you have a clear view of what you want to be doing, two things happen:

 *  You see opportunities more quickly and clearly and can pursue them with more focus. 

 *  Other people find opportunities for you and create connections for you because they know you’re the
person who does that thing.

It’s harder than it sounds, making that decision and communicating it, but it’s well worth the
effort.
