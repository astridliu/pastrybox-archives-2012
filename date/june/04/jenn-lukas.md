Remember how cool it was when you first learned how to tween objects in Flash? That’s how I feel about
using CSS transitions with hovers. It’s my favorite thing about the web right now, which is why this
isn’t the first time I’ve [written about
it](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/the-importance-of-conventions) or [talked about
it](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/64) . I just can’t seem to get enough of the awesomeness that we are
applying to our links. From subtle color changes as seen on the links of [Owltastic](http://owltastic.com/) to
more apparent size changes, such as the ones I recently worked on for the [Online Music
Awards](http://www.omusicawards.com/vote), there are a plethora of enhancements we can add to our styles. When
done with the audience in mind, they can add just the right amount of fun and class to your interactions. And
don’t we all know if there’s anything the internet needs more of (besides kittens), it’s
class.
