       <p>We had some family over to visit for the weekend recently. Over aglass or two of wine we were discussing kids, the news, health, work, the usual stuff. The couple both happen to be police officers. My wife&rsquo;s cousin told us about a particular incident she&rsquo;d attended in which a teenage boy had hanged himself. It was her and her fellow officers duty to inform the boy&rsquo;s parents of this terrible, tragic news.</p><p>They arrived at the house to let the parents know what had happened and offer support. When the door opened the parents were clearly distraught and in floods of tears. They already knew what had happened to their darling boy.</p><p>Later it transpired that the parents had found out the news not only of their son&rsquo;s death but also the circumstances via their neighbour, who had in-turn found out on Facebook.</p><p>Sometimes I think the Internet is the most wonderful of things. Other times I think it&rsquo;s the most terrible of things.</p>
