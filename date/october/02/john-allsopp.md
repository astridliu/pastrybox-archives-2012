One of the advantages of being (relatively) old in a relatively young field is you’ve witnessed
firsthand important milestones, the emergence of ideas, significant debates and other formative aspects of
that field. In many other fields, these events are ancient history, their protagonists long gone, their
importance fading.

Recently, I’ve been taking [something of a walk down memory lane](http://webdirections.org/history/),
looking at some of the history of the web (things like browser releases, publication dates for specifications
and so on).

What it has emphasised for me is not so much how far we have come, but in many ways how little. Here’s a
simple example:

That’s ViolaWWW, one of the earliest graphical web browsers, originally released March 9, 1992, so over
20 years ago. At first glance it looks so primitive. But take a closer look. There’s the home, back and
forward buttons. There’s a url field. And inside the window, a page full of text with links to
click.

And how about this:

Google’s home page from 1998. While visually quite different, again, essentially the same user
experience as Google today. And it doesn’t stop there. Think about search engine results. In essence, a
list of around a dozen potential matches, with a short description and a link for users to follow. This really
hasn’t changed at all since the very beginning of the web. (Results have become more relevant, but when
was the last time you went beyond the first page of results? Beyond the first two or three results? Surely
with billions of documents, for any search there’s likely to be more than a handful of relevant
results?)

So what’s the point?

To some extent we live in an ever-present now, of exciting cool new stuff. To put it harshly, we live in
George Santayana’s perpetual infancy. We should step back once in a while, from the sense of excitement
mixed with panic, that we are missing out, that it will all pass us by, and get a sense of perspective, of
where we have come from, and maybe even think a little about where we are going.
