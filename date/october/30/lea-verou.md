These days, we almost all unequivocally embrace graceful degradation and progressive enhancement. It’s the
extent that people disagree on, since everyone has a different definition of what is “graceful”
and what is “enhancement”. Is a solid color an acceptable fallback for a pattern? What if your
lightbox has no overlay? What if your stripes become a solid color? What if your transitions are not there?
What if your code has no syntax highlighting? That’s the true challenge: How different can they look? Is it
sufficient if the content is accessible in IE8 or does it also have to be pretty? How pretty? Those are the
questions you need to agree on with your team to ensure you’re all on the same page. An agreement on the
basic premise that websites don’t have to look the same in every browser is far from enough. Graceful
degradation is not black & white, it’s a spectrum. You need to find where you lie on that spectrum and where
your colleagues lie on it too, otherwise expect a lot of tension every time decisions need to be made.
