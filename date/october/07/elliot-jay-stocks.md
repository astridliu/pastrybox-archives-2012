I’ve been lucky enough to experience a fair few product launches and there is absolutely nothing like
the adrenaline rush that comes with the occasion: pouring over something for months on end to finally unveil
it to the world, nervously wondering if anyone will like what you’ve created. And then, when they do,
and the orders start coming in, the adrenaline rush begins anew. *Oh my god! People are actually buying it!*
This is what happened to us on Wednesday 19th September at 4pm when we finally released [Insites: The
Book](http://viewportindustries.com/products/insites-the-book/).

With that second rush of adrenaline, though, comes a rush of a different kind: gratitude. Humbled, honoured
gratitude. Because suddenly people are parting with their hard-earned cash to buy something you’ve made,
and that is just an incredible feeling. This book is not an essential item. No-one *needs* this book. But here
they are, paying for something they believe in. And that’s really why it’s so humbling: each and
every purchase is a person saying: *I believe in what you’re doing and I want to support it.*

And, wow, we are so, so grateful for that. Thank you.
