       <h1>Remember to trust in serendipity.</h1><p>I’ve spent the last 4 weeks in Europe: one in Bologna, Italy for a conference, and the remaining three in Zurich to visit my oldest friend in the world and her two daughters.<p>These past couple of weeks in Zurich I’ve been holed up in my friend’s comfortable digs making the most of the free wifi. Why? My time has been spent between 3 major tasks: preparing a completely new presentation for my next speaking engagement in Paris next week, working on my current client project, and plotting out what my next professional move will be.<p>Consulting has fantastic benefits, such as time autonomy, interesting projects, and learning new things. However, for me the advantages are outweighed by the minuses of uneven cash flow, feeling isolated, and doing work that no longer interests me. In short, I am weary of consulting. I am ready to have a job again.<p>So, this week, I’ve polished up my resume. Throwing caution to the wind, via Twitter, have asked for<ol><li><p> peer review of it:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/denisejacobs/status/256007507552632834">I've just updated my resume for the first time in YEARS. Is anyone willing to look it over and give me some constructive feedback pls?</a> </p><p>and</p> </li><li> <p>leads/connections </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/denisejacobs/status/256778934279098369">Working upon finding my dream job where I speak/train, write &amp; strategize around creativity-innovation-productivity. Any ideas/leads? TIA!</a></p> </li></ol><p>(and&nbsp;<a href="http://denisejacobs.com/contact-me/">yes, I am still open to both if you want to help!</a>)</p><p>I believe my efforts have tipped off the serendipity police, so to speak. I made the decision to really start pouring energy and focus into my “new position manifestation” process on Tuesday evening. That same evening, I got an email from my only other buddy in Zurich inviting me to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.internations.org/">InterNations</a>&nbsp;networker the next day. Having spent most of my time working from home, I happily signed up to attend.</p><p>I arrived at the venue, and did not even get into the door when I met another attendee who looked/felt as if I had met her before. I racked my brain, suggesting a litany of places where we could have known each other, but nothing matched. She asked me what I do, and I told her “I speak and write on creativity, the creative process, productivity and innovation,” which usually gets a polite response of “oh, that’s interesting…”. In stark contrast, this woman perks up: it turns out that she is taking a 5-day course on innovation management. She immediately suggests that I come by the course the next day to meet the professor, learn about both him and his innovation consulting firm called&nbsp;<a href="http://brainconnection.ch/">Brain Connection</a>, and meet the other students in the class.</p><p>Seriously?! Yes, seriously. Excitedly, I send her an email and text the next morning to confirm that I can come by. I meet the group for lunch and have a nice conversation with the professor. On the way to the classroom from lunch, I chat with another person from the group, whom I thought was a student. It turns out that he works for a company here in Zurich called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.denkmotor.com/">DenkMotor</a>&nbsp;who is the other contributor to the event. What does this company do?&nbsp;<em>They teach workshops and lead trainings on creativity, the creative process, design thinking and innovation.</em></p><p>Seriously??! Yes, seriously! Today, in just a few hours, I will be having brunch with the woman I met, the guy who leads the creativity workshops, and a couple other people from the networker. What’s going to happen? You’ve got me—the outcome could just be a nice meal with new friends.</p><p>But this situation makes me feel as if there is a sort of barely detectable force, a sort of magic even, shimmering right underneath the surface of our everyday existence, waiting for us to take notice. Clearly, serendipity is a part of that force, and I’m not complaining. In fact, I’m in hopeful expectation of the next “happy accident” and my new awesome job, whatever it may be.</p>
