Not everyone who works with technology loves technology. No, really, it’s true! Most of the people out
there building stuff with web tech don’t attend conferences, don’t talk about WebGL in the pub,
don’t write a blog with CSS3 “experiments” in it, don’t like what they do. It’s
a job: come in at 9, go home at 5, don’t think about HTML outside those hours. Apparently 90% of the
stuff in the universe is “dark matter”: undetectable, doesn’t interact with other matter,
can’t be seen even with a really big telescope. Our “dark matter developers”, who
aren’t part of the community, who barely even know that the community exists… how are we to help
them? You can write all the A List Apart articles you like but dark matter developers don’t read it. And
so everyone’s intranet is horrid and Internet-Explorer-specific and so the IE team have to maintain
backwards compatibility with that and that hurts the web. What can we do to reach this huge group of people?
Everyone’s written a book about web technologies, and books help, but books are dying. We want to get
the word out about all the amazing things that are now possible to everyone: do we know how? Do we even have
to care? The theory is that this stuff will “trickle down”, but that doesn’t work for
economics: I’m not sure it works for`@-moz-keyframes` either.
