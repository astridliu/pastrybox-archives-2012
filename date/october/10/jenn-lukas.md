Last month, I fractured the tibia bone in my leg. Being on crutches and in a wheelchair has really changed the
way I view getting around. I’ve begun to notice things like which street corners have curb ramps and
which ones don't. When trying to ride the subway, I’ve been baffled by who put in the lift that leads to
a staircase. I’ve been amazed at the way strangers will ask you “what happened” with dropped
jaws. In general, it’s been eye-opening. 

While I think I am empathetic toward situations that necessitate accessibility requirements, until we are in
one, there’s only so much assuming we can do. I wonder if we took a few weeks and browsed websites using
only a keyboard or only looked at sites on a PC, how/if that would change the way we design and code websites.
