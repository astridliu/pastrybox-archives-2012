Ever work on an open source project? If so, and for long enough, youâ€™ve likely encountered users who
feel entitled and become abusive when the code does not work the way they expect, or contributors who belittle
the contributions of others.

If these same people worked face to face, would they act the same way? And if they did, would we tolerate
it?

We would not. Disagreements can happen and still be conducted in a civil fashion. We should not tolerate
abusive behavior online.
