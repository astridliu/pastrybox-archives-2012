Process is for fast food restaurants. I’m much more interested in skill. 

Skilled people without a process will always find a way to get things done. Skill begets process. But process
doesn’t beget skill. Following a recipe won’t make you a great chef – it just means you can make a
competent bolognese. Great chefs don’t need cookery books. They know their medium and their ingredients so
well that they can find excellent combinations as they go. The recipe becomes a natural by-product of their
work.

Sure, if you have a low-skilled team, or inefficiencies and costs are your top priority, process matters. But
for knowledge workers, skill is more important. The best people don't care whether agile/waterfall/lean is the
flavor of the month, or what job title they should hold. Instead, they care about practicing their craft, and
being better than they were yesterday.
