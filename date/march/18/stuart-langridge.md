Publish and be damned, said the Duke of Wellington; these days, in between starting wars in France and being
sick of everyone repeating the jokes about his name from Blackadder, he’d probably say that we should
publish *or* be damned. If you’re anything like me, you’ve got folders full of little experiments
that you never got around to finishing or that didn’t pan out. Put ’em up somewhere. These things
are useful.

Twitter, autobiographies, collections of letters from authors, all these have shown us that the minutiae can
be as fascinating as carefully curated and sieved and measured writings, and who knows what you’ll
inspire the next person to do from the germ of one of your ideas?
