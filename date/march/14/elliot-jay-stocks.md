I have a relatively low attention span when it comes to design, in that something I'm proud of one week I'm
ashamed of the next. It's a terrible trait when working on large projects, because either my enthusiasm
dwindles and / or I'm eager to work on the next version of a design almost as soon as the previous one is
signed off.

Instead of trying to fight this urge, I've decided to embrace it this year. Last year I stripped back my site
so it would be a relatively blank canvas upon which I could build. I'm doing the same to the new Viewport
Industries site we're about to launch. Build up, tear down, but leave the foundations.

Perfect for those of us always keen to move on to the next thing.
