Just like buses, which arrive all at once when you’ve been waiting for ages, this last month or so has
seen the launch of several apps / networks offering a new take on web-based
discourse: [App.Net](https://join.app.net/), an
open, [user-funded](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/why-you-should-back-appnet-and-now/) alternative to
Twitter; [Branch](http://branch.com/), an attempt to engage users in real-life-like, long-form discussion;
and [Medium](https://medium.com/), Obvious Corporation’s bold — *very* bold — re-imagining of
online publishing.

Does the arrival of these services herald a new age for discussion / publishing / connectivity? Perhaps.
Either way, I would urge you to read [Daniel Howells’ thoughts on ‘the problem and the fragmentation
of content and
communication’](http://howells.ws/posts/view/150/the-problem-and-the-fragmentation-of-content-and-communication).
These are exciting times.
