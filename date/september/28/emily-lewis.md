I’m not an “early adopter.” I don’t get excited about gadgets, phones, computers or
even new software. It takes me forever to make a decision about what to buy if I need a new tool, and even
longer to actually make the purchase. New techniques are interesting, but I always take (probably too much)
time to experiment before I’m “convinced.”

But damn if I don’t grab my username immediately upon hearing of any new service.
