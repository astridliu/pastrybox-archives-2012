# A Life Decision Workflow

At this very moment, I’m sitting in the hospital with my 94 year old grandmother, who, a mere 4 days ago,
suffered from a massive stroke. Most of her brain function is lost. Before the stroke, she was already blind
from adult onset diabetes. At present, not only can she not see, but she can no longer move, eat or drink. She
has been moved to the in-hospital hospice. Both husband and her progeny are waiting. While we wait, looking at
her slack face and now snow white hair thinly covering her scalp, I am compelled to muse upon the expanse of
life that we are given. I feel compelled to try to devise ways to improve upon my own life and make my
grandmother’s contribution in giving me an opportunity to be born into this world worth it.

One practice that I can now see has led me astray is operating from a long list of “should”s. Some of my
major choices in my life have been embarked upon based on thoughts such as these:

> 
>  *  “I should play it safe and not let him know how I really feel”
>  *  “I should get a sensible degree instead of doing art”
>  *  “I should go help my sister with her business after I graduate”
>  *  “I should go into project management because it pays well”
>  *  “I should go ahead and get involved with him because he seems really into me”
>  *  “I should just work all of the time and not take time for myself — then I will be able to get more
> done”

You may have guessed that the outcome of many of these decisions ended up being…ummm, interesting. The parts
of my life directed by shoulds were not enjoyable — indeed, many ended up being some of the worst periods of
my life.

Watching my grandmother’s breathing progress from strong snoring to apneatic gasps, it is becoming
increasingly clear that our time, energy, and attention on this planet are far too precious for “should”.
This brings to mind two pieces of wisdom that inspire me: Derek Siver’s “[Hell
yeah!](http://sivers.org/hellyeah)” and Frank Chimero’s [Proposed Creative
Workflow](http://acreativedose.com/2012/08/30/a-creative-workflow/). I’m ready to embrace the simplicity,
self-respect, and courage of “[Hell Yeah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehWlVeMrqw)”. I’m moving to
embodying the trust and honesty necessary to choose only that which truly has heart.

If your previous life decisions have been governed by shoulds like so many of mine have, and you are
consequently harboring a latent dissatisfaction with your life in certain areas, then join me in starting to
question every single last “should” on your list. My idea for my new Life Decision Workflow is to replace
all “should”s with “I can’t wait to…!” to test the strength of the idea. If this new version of
the phrase rings true, then you know that not only does it have heart, but that you have a hell yeah situation
on your hands. If not, then cross it off the list. I know it sounds trite, but life really is too short to
waste.
