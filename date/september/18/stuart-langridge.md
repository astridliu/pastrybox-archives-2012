Software isn’t always a solution to problems. If you’re a developer, everything generally looks
like a nail: a nail which is solved by making a new bit of code. I’ve got half-finished mobile apps done
for tracking my running with GPS, for telling me when to switch between running and walking, and…
I’m still fat, because I’m writing software instead of *going running*. One of the big ideas
behind computers was to automate repetitive and boring tasks, certainly, which means that it should work like
this: identify a thing that needs doing, do it for a while, think “hm, a computer could do this more
easily”, write a bit of software to do it. However, there’s too much premature optimisation going
on, so it actually looks like this: identify a thing that needs doing, think “hm, I’m sure a
computer would be able to do this more easily”, write a bit of software to do it. See the difference? If
the software never gets finished, then in the first approach the thing *still gets done*. Don’t always
reach for the keyboard: sometimes it’s better to reach for Post-It notes, or your running shoes.
