# Experimenting is vital in each design process… 

A lot of experimentation goes into each design I create. I believe it’s the most vital, but also the
most fun part of the creative process. Trying things out and seeing where you get, then comparing with other
options you’ve tried etc. It’s one way to ensure the final design is created at your best
potential. The process of my creations is usually very chaotic, due to all the things I try out along the way:
looking for the perfect colors, perfect composition, perfect texture etc. A lot of undoing and deleting is
part of this process, and maybe 90% of the things I create along the way gets trashed. I almost never have my
exact final result in my head. It’s more like a basic concept, or sometimes just a vague idea of the
direction I want to take. While trying all kinds of things out, I sometimes end up with a surprising result,
and these results sometimes lead to new ideas. Sometimes the end result is way better than my initial idea.
That’s why I think experimenting is so vital in each design process.
