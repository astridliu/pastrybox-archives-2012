I’ve been designing primarily in the browser for the past year. Responsive design has brought with it a
new way of thinking—we simply can’t rely on the idea that every user is viewing a website on a certain
width of screen. Whether it’s mobile, tablet, desktop, or television, the site’s content is
paramount. Designing in Photoshop simply doesn’t make sense any more. Photoshop comps don’t scale.
Sure, you could create several layer groups or documents for different break points, but there’s no way
to actually tell how it’ll perform in the browser without building it in the browser in the first
place.

Design in the browser. Of course, still use Photoshop for asset building, but work in markup as soon as you
can.
