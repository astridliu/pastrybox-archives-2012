If you’re feeling like you’re having a down day at work — everything seems mundane, ordinary,
unexciting, or you don’t know why you’re there — explain what you do to someone. Tell them about
what you’re building, why it matters and what makes it a challenge. Why did you join up and what are the
big-picture outcomes?

If explaining what you do doesn’t instantly lift your mood and make you excited about creating things,
maybe it *is* time to dust off the CV.
