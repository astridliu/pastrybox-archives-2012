A PSD/PNG should be nothing more than an *idea* of a website. It should give clues and a direction to the
build, but ultimately should not be treated as a final design. Following PSDs to the pixel will lead to
ill-considered code, and code is your final product, not an image. For example, if your PSD uses three shades
of very similar blue, the build should pick and honour just one. There is no point repeating similar
declarations in your CSS when a happy middle-ground is more efficient, easier and quicker. __A PSD is a clue,
not a contract__.
