If you work for yourself, either as a freelancer or as part of a small business, it’s easy to forget
that you “run” a business. It’s easy to spend all your time “in” the business,
i.e. doing the work, and not enough time “on” the business, i.e. maintaining client relationships,
lining up work or doing the accounts. 

It’s not easy but to save your sanity at your end of year try spending a bit of time each week
“on” your business. Take it from someone who learnt the hard way! Above all your accountant will
love you for it.
