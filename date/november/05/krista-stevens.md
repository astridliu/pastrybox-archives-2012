Summer is long over and fall arrives with a flurry of new activity: you recommit to old projects as new
projects surface. There’s yard work, taking the boys to hockey, organizing family events, cooking,
cleaning, and readying for winter. I find the days of my life seem to fly by like fence pickets as you drive
down the highway. Once a month, I sit down and take stock. Are my life goals still the same? How much closer
am I to achieving them? Do I need to push myself more? What do I need to adjust? How’s the balance? I
find that this short, but necessary reflection is the difference between mere existence and an examined
life.
