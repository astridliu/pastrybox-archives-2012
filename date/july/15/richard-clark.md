My wife is a dietitian. We were talking about work one evening and she was explaining about how she felt ok
upsetting the family of a patient over a course of action because it was for the good of the patient. 

It got me thinking about the parallels that can be drawn with our line of work. Consider the family to be our
clients and the users, our patients. We have to make decisions for the good of users that might upset the
client. The slight difference in our case is that we have to balance business objectives with user needs.
Perhaps next time youâ€™re drawn into this kind of discussion with a client you can find similar examples
that they can relate to (perhaps in their line of work) to help make your point.
