One of my favourite books is a tiny slender volume called ‘A Technique for Producing Ideas’ by
James Webb Young. The book is actually targeted towards people in advertising, but has a lot of relevance for
anyone who is involved in creative problem solving.

I think it’s a particularly good summertime read for anyone who is looking for a good excuse to get out
of the office and enjoy some good weather or the good things that people tend to do when the weather is
fine.

In the book the author tells us that ideas are made up of a combination of old elements—usually an element
which is specific to our problem area and another idea which is general. 

We’re usually pretty good at gathering specific ideas as we sit glued to Twitter, reading each
other’s blogs, our ears finely attuned to the industry echo chamber. 

What we’re often not so good at is the ideas that are more general. But this is what summer is great
for. General ideas come from the rest of life. From being out and in that life, engaging with it, being
interested in it, exploring things that have absolutely no relevance to our work or the problem space
we’re exploring.

The author says:

> Every good creative person in advertising whom I have ever known has
> always had two noticeable characteristics. First, there was no subject under the sun in which he could not
> easily get interested—from, say, Egyptian burial customs to modern art. Every facet of life had fascination
> for him. Second, he was an extensive browser in all sorts of fields of information. For it is with the
> advertising man as with the cow, no browsing, no milk.

Make it your mission this summer (and beyond) to get out into the world and to browse widely and interestedly
in things that you’ve never paid attention to before. That have nothing to do with the internet, with
your profession. Fill your mind with diverse experiences and engage with them fully.

And don’t try to turn these new experiences into solutions or creative ideas on the fly. Let them
settle. When describing the ‘mental digestive process’ James Webb Young also confirms that time
not thinking about the problem is essential. He advises that we ‘drop the entire subject and put the
idea out of your mind as completely as possible’, to ‘turn the problem over to your unconscious
mind and let it work while you sleep.’ 

Almost always the best solutions to complicated problems come to us when we’re away from our desk.
Sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes in the shower, sometimes midway through a run. 

We need to be more disciplined about giving problems a proper diet of new and diverse experience, and then
giving them space to roll over in our mind, to find new combinations and for interesting ideas to emerge. 

We need to be more disciplined about giving ourselves a break. 

So, get started this summer—step away from your desk, go out and indulge in the rest of life and know that,
as you do it, you’re also making yourself better at your work. And enjoy yourself while you let your
unconscious mind do its thing.
