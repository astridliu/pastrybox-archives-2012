       <p>One of my favourite books is a tiny slender volume called &lsquo;A Technique for Producing Ideas&rsquo; by James Webb Young. The book is actually targeted towards people in advertising, but has a lot of relevance for anyone who is involved in creative problem solving.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s a particularly good summertime read for anyone who is looking for a good excuse to get out of the office and enjoy some good weather or the good things that people tend to do when the weather is fine.</p><p>In the book the author tells us that ideas are made up of a combination of old elements—usually an element which is specific to our problem area and another idea which is general. </p><p>We&rsquo;re usually pretty good at gathering specific ideas as we sit glued to Twitter, reading each other&rsquo;s blogs, our ears finely attuned to the industry echo chamber. </p><p>What we&rsquo;re often not so good at is the ideas that are more general. But this is what summer is great for. General ideas come from the rest of life. From being out and in that life, engaging with it, being interested in it, exploring things that have absolutely no relevance to our work or the problem space we&rsquo;re exploring.</p><p>The author says:</p><blockquote><p>Every good creative person in advertising whom I have ever known has always had two noticeable characteristics. First, there was no subject under the sun in which he could not easily get interested—from, say, Egyptian burial customs to modern art. Every facet of life had fascination for him. Second, he was an extensive browser in all sorts of fields of information. For it is with the advertising man as with the cow, no browsing, no milk.</p></blockquote><p>Make it your mission this summer (and beyond) to get out into the world and to browse widely and interestedly in things that you&rsquo;ve never paid attention to before. That have nothing to do with the internet, with your profession. Fill your mind with diverse experiences and engage with them fully.</p><p>And don&rsquo;t try to turn these new experiences into solutions or creative ideas on the fly. Let them settle. When describing the &lsquo;mental digestive process&rsquo; James Webb Young also confirms that time not thinking about the problem is essential. He advises that we &lsquo;drop the entire subject and put the idea out of your mind as completely as possible&rsquo;, to &lsquo;turn the problem over to your unconscious mind and let it work while you sleep.&rsquo; </p><p>Almost always the best solutions to complicated problems come to us when we&rsquo;re away from our desk. Sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes in the shower, sometimes midway through a run. </p><p>We need to be more disciplined about giving problems a proper diet of new and diverse experience, and then giving them space to roll over in our mind, to find new combinations and for interesting ideas to emerge. </p><p>We need to be more disciplined about giving ourselves a break. </p><p>So, get started this summer—step away from your desk, go out and indulge in the rest of life and know that, as you do it, you&rsquo;re also making yourself better at your work. And enjoy yourself while you let your unconscious mind do its thing.</p><p><em>(With apologies to Southern Hemisphere readers and those in the UK assuming the weather will have turned bad again by the time this is published)</em></p>
