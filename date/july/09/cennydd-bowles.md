Sustainable design matters even in the digital world. Our raw materials—information, effort, money—may not
be mined from the earth, but they’re still in scarce supply. We have a duty to conserve them.

Responsive web design is essentially a sustainable design manifesto, reducing the need for clients to retreat
to the drawing board with every new trend, every new device. RWD isn’t about designing for today’s
technology: it’s about designing for tomorrow’s.

Predicting the future sounds daunting, but if you scan the horizon you can spot the silhouettes: pervasive
high-density displays, increased use of touch and voice, users bouncing between multiple devices. We
shouldn’t wait until these issues burst into the mainstream before considering their impact.

So are you making something that will live into the future? Or will your work just contribute to the digital
landfill?
