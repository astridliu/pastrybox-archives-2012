Here in the UK, summer has been cancelled and we’re awaiting the hoards for the Olympics in a couple of
weeks. It struck me that it’s the perfect time to take a break—and I mean a real one—and escape the
slightly disappointing condition of the climate here. Which is exactly what I did, and just got back from my
first trip to a foreign land in a long while that didn’t involve also intending a conference. And it was
great—I feel refreshed, focussed and significantly more enthused about the work I was doing before I
left.

I think those of us who are enthusiastic about our jobs, and consider ourselves “lifestyle nerds”
rarely stop and do something unrelated to our work, often spending free time reading on-topic, at conferences,
or working on side projects. We tend to consider just “not being in the office” as enough, and
consider that alone to be the same as taking abreak.

So, other than gloating about being away, my recommendation is to go outside and forget about the internet.
It’ll still be here when you get back.
