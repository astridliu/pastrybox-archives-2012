Of all the things I’ve learnt over the 12 months I’ve been in my work placement for University,
dealing with criticism has been the most valuable.

When I first started, I was producing mediocre designs and mediocre code; very much still finding my feet in
design & development. The only thing that has changed in that time is the thickness of my skin. I’ll
never forget the day my boss turned to me and told me a mockup I’d done was—in her words—crap. I
grinned like an idiot that day.

Similarly, I recently posted a shot on dribbble for a mini-project I was pretty happy with. Out of the blue, a
friend told me I could do a lot better. I needed to hear that. All I’d had for a long time was the
encouragement of strangers—it was refreshing to have someone (specifically, someone whose opinion I trust)
tell me I can do better.

So encourage your colleagues and friends to criticise you. Do it yourself, too. Be honest. You can do
better.
