For the last several decades, we’ve created varieties of the same CRUD tool. Whether it’s writing
a Word doc, posting to Facebook, or checking in with FourSquare, these are all tools for Creating (and
Reading, Updating, Deleting) information. Add to this all the ways to passively collect data—your mobile
phone alone collects more than 700 points of data per day—and we’ve got a curious situation: Too much
information and no good way to make sense of it all. We need new tools for understanding this information.
Tools that let us explore, evaluate, and synthesize information. Tools that support cognitively complex
activities. 

When people ask me about “what’s next in design?” I think about this problem of too much
information. New planets are discovered nearly every week, it seems, while back on Earth companies are
scratching their heads trying to figure out what to do with all their customer data. We have scientists
looking for patterns in strands of DNA. From cinematography to medicine, we’re getting sharper
details—what used to be a few x-rays on a lightbox is now a terrabyte of data mapping your entire body. Add
to this the growing number of people monitoring their own health patterns, social interactions, and all sort
of minutia, and we’ve got some thrilling challenges waiting for us! How are we going to help turn
information into understanding?

I favor visualizations as a way to make sense of it all, if only for the reason that our sense of vision is
the most highly evolved sensory organ, capable of picking out minute differences in detail. Much has been
written about the power images and pictures to aid in understanding. But there’s more to come than
infographics and data visualizations displayed on a screen. Consider how coupled interaction is with thinking.
We don’t necessarily think and then do. We also think through doing. When you hold a chess piece in
mid-air, considering possible moves, the board has become part of your thinking space. You are using the chess
board to extend beyond the limitations of your short-term, working memory. In this way, the environment
outside of our bodies helps us to think and understand. Karl Fast says it best: “the problem space is
now partly in the head and partly in the world, with interaction linking and blending these two spaces
together.” By interacting with this external representation we have the potential to learn more deeply
and to see more options, as with the chess player evaluating possible outcomes. This is partly why I favor
interactive visualization. But what happens when interactions involve far more than a simple mouse click or
tap of the finger? What happens when communication, movement, motion, position and other forms of interaction
become part of the designers toolbox? That, for me, is a thrilling future. New forms of interaction helping us
make sense of the world around us… CRUD tools, and to be fair, tools for sorting, filtering and searching
content, are going to seem crude when compared to whatever comes next!
