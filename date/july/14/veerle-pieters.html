       <p>Not sure about you, but I don&rsquo;t really like emails from people asking if you can Skype or &ldquo;chat&rdquo; with them to discuss &ldquo;a project&rdquo;, without properly introducing themselves or the project. I try to figure out the company from the domain name of their email address… but usually it&rsquo;s a Gmail address. I wonder if they really think they&rsquo;ll get a &ldquo;yes sure&rdquo; answer to that. :) It&rsquo;s pretty basic advice to always properly present yourself so we know who you are. Secondly, give a short description of the project you&rsquo;d like to discuss. Even better, if you are in the discussion phase, make sure you have well-prepared documents that you can share. </p><p>I often get emails from people who would love to &ldquo;work together&rdquo; with me or my company, which is great, but some of these emails are really vague. They often end with &ldquo;let me know if you are interested&rdquo; without actually offering or presenting anything concrete. They always expect you to &ldquo;present something&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to sound pedantic, but if people approach you like that, than they should not expect you to do their homework, right? It&rsquo;s like they think you&rsquo;re doing nothing, just waiting for their email… I believe it&rsquo;s just a matter of being polite, and efficient. This kind of vague email communication is equal to a pure waste of time since you have to send emails back and forth a couple of times, asking questions etc. just until you might receive the email that you should have had in the first place. So it&rsquo;s important to be clear and to the point, while introducing yourself and your project via email. Don&rsquo;t expect people to answer positively if you don&rsquo;t properly tell who you are or don&rsquo;t make the effort to properly describe the project, or idea of working together.</p>
