I recently attended a graduate recruitment event to talk to students about coming to work with us at
[KMP.](http://kmp.co.uk) A lot of them offered to send me their CVs, some offered to send their pdf
portfolios.

I told each of them that I wouldn't read them. I'm more interested in personality and your work - online.
Sure, some background is important but generally I want to be sent URLs, Github accounts, your @ name etc; you
get the picture.

Maybe I'm in the minority here, but it seems to me that schools, colleges and universities need to wise up and
move with the times both in terms of course content, gaining employment and more. Creating closer links
between industry and education has to be the way to go. It's time to talk.
