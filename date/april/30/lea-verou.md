The best argument against conventional wisdom is the fate of everyone following it. If you aspire beyond
mediocrity, conventional wisdom is recipe for failure. Think out of the box. What can you do to achieve your
goals, that others are not already doing? The least popular paths are the most successful. The trick isn't
doing better than the others, it's minimizing the number of "others". Find unexplored territory and make it
yours. It's much easier than trying to claim your stake on someone else's land.
