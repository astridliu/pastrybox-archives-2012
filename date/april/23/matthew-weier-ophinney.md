As a project lead, I'm often looked to for guidance or approval of ideas. Interestingly, I do the sameâ€”but
perhaps for a different reason. I toss my ideas over the fence in the hopes that somebody else will be able to
execute it better than me, or come up with an even better design. Usually, they can and do.
