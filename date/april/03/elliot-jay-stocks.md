I keep coming back to the idea that there *must* be a better way to handle email. No matter what I do, and
even with [the aid of TextExpander for faster
replies](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/using-textexpander-to-conquer-email/), it just eats into so much of
my day. Even two hours of emailing per day equates to ten hours per week, which is more than a whole day of
actual work. Something has to change. It's ridiculous.

So in the next couple of weeks I'm going to move all of my email to Gmail (finally) and go to town with
creating a few intelligent rules that can — to a point — send out canned responses that take the onus off
me. Will it work? Will it come across as impersonal? Possibly. But email is taking over my life and I just
can't stand it anymore.
