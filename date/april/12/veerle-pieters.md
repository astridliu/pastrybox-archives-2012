In my humble opinion, you become a great designer only if you try to find a balance between what the client
likes and what you like. After all, you design for the client, not for yourself. The client has to be 100%
satisfied. But don't get me wrong here, it's not a one-way communication where the designer blindly follows
what the client dictates. 

Sometimes, the client's feedback has no valuable points; then it's up to you to explain why you think the
client's direction is not a good one. Finding a "middle ground" doesn't mean you end up with a dull result.


Sometimes the client will agree with you, especially with people who actually choose you because they like
your "design style". 

You just have to try to push yourself to the limit in order to be as creative as possible. Take the client's
feedback into account: that can only help you improve your design, whether the feedback is valuable or not,
positive or not.

If you do that, in a lot of cases you'll end up with a great result, and it's always very fulfilling when that
actually happens.
